Abstract

In this paper, we consider meromorphic extension of the function


h k [(][r][)]
k [s] [,][ Re (][s][)][ > r,]


ζ h (r) (s) =


∞
�

k=1


(which we call hyperharmonic zeta function) where h n [(][r][)] are the hyperharmonic numbers. We establish certain constants, denoted γ h (r) (m),
which naturally occur in the Laurent expansion of ζ h (r) (s). Moreover,
we show that the constants γ h (r) (m) and integrals involving generalized
exponential integral can be written as a finite combination of some special

constants.
### 1 Introduction

has an analytic continuation to the whole complex s plane except for a simple
pole s = 1 with residue 1. It is well known that around this simple pole, ζ (s)
has the following Laurent expansion

where the coefficients γ (m) are called Stieltjes constants. It is shown by various
authors that these constants can be alternatively presented by the limit

The special case m = 0 is the famous Euler-Mascheroni constant γ ′ = γ (0) =
0.577 215 664 9 . . .. Besides, the constant γ has relation ψ (1) = Γ (1) = −γ,

is Euler’s gamma function and ψ (x) = Γ (x) /Γ (x) is the digamma function
(e.g. [32]). It is well-known that for a positive integer n, ψ (n + 1) + γ = H n =
1 + 1/2 + · · · + 1/n, where H n are the harmonic numbers.
There is comprehensive literature on deriving series and integral representations for the Stieltjes constants and their extensions (see for example [4, 5, 13,
14, 15, 33, 22]). These representations usually allow a more accurate estimation
of mentioned constants (see for example [1, 3, 5]).
The Dirichlet series associated with harmonic numbers, so called harmonic
zeta function, is defined by


ζ H (s) =

The harmonic zeta function has been studied by many authors. Euler [21, pp.
217–264] gives a closed form formula for ζ H (s) in terms of the Riemann zeta
values when s ∈ N\ {1}. Apostol and Vu [2] and Matsuoka [27] show that the
function ζ H can be continued meromorphically to the whole complex s plane
except for the poles s = 1, s = 0 and s = 1 − 2j, j ∈ N. Later, Boyadzhiev et
al. [7] deal with the Laurent expansion of the harmonic zeta function

ζ H (s) = [a] [−][1] (3)

s − b [+][ a] [0] [ +][ O][ (][s][ −] [b][)][,]

and give explicitly the coefficient a 0 when b = 0 and b = 1 − 2j, j ∈ N. Recently,
using the Ramanujan summation method, Candelpergher and Coppo [12] record
that the harmonic Stieltjes constants γ H (m) defined by the Laurent expansion


(s − 1) [m], 0 < |s − 1| < 1

Besides they also present γ H (0) explicitly and rediscover the coefficient a 0 in
(3).
We now introduce the main object of this study, the hyperharmonic zeta
function:


h [(] k [r][)]
k [s] [,][ Re (][s][)][ > r,]

ζ h (r) (s) =

where h [(] n [r][)] are the hyperharmonic numbers defined by [16]


n [, n, r][ ∈] [N][.]


h [(] n [r][)] =


n
�


� h [(] k [r][−][1)] with h [(0)] n = n [1]

k=1


It is clear that ζ h (0) (s) = ζ (s + 1) and ζ h (1) (s) = ζ H (s) . The Dirichlet series
� ∞k=1 [h] [(] k [r][)] [/k] [s] [ converges absolutely and represents an analytic function of][ s][ for]
Re (s) > r since h [(] n [r][)] = O �n [r][−][1] ln n� . Kamano [24] has shown that the function
ζ h (r) (s) can be continued meromorphically to the whole complex s plane except
for the double poles at s = 1, 2, . . ., r and an infinite number of simple poles
at s = −k, k ∈ N ∪{0}. For positive integer values of s, in which case it is
called Euler sum of the hyperharmonic numbers [29], it has enjoyed considerable
attention in a number of publications during the last decade. For instance,
evaluations of ζ h (r) (m), m ∈ N and their extensions in terms of the Riemann
zeta values and some other special constants can be found in [11, 18, 25, 29, 36].
The aim of this paper is to determine certain constants which naturally occur
in the Laurent expansion of hyperharmonic zeta function.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we prove that the
function ζ h (r) has a meromorphic continuation (Theorem 1). In Section 3 we
present the Laurent expansion of the hyperharmonic zeta function in the region
0 < |s − r| < 1 (Theorem 3). For appearing coefficients, denoted γ h (r) (m), we
obtain the following limit representation

by modifying the method of Briggs and Buschman [8]. It is clear that the
coefficients γ h (r) (m), which we call hyperharmonic Stieltjes constants, reduce to
the Stieltjes constants γ (m) when r = 0 (with the assumption ψ (0) /Γ (0) =
lim r→0 ψ (r) /Γ (r) = −1) and to the harmonic Stieltjes constants γ H (m) when
r = 1. In Section 4 we confer two more representations for γ h (r) (m) in addition
to (4). The first one is in terms of Stieltjes constants γ h (r−1) (m), γ (m) and
values related to the zeta function (Theorem 8). The second one is in terms of
Stieltjes constants γ H (m), γ (m) and some other special values related to the
Riemann zeta function (Theorem 10). In Section 5, we consider the limit

### 2 Meromorphic continuation

The following theorem, which was firstly proven by Kamano [24, Theorem 1.1],
gives the meromorphic continuation of the function ζ h (r) . Here we give a slightly
different proof.

Theorem 1 Let r be a non-negative integer. The function ζ h (r) has a meromorphic continuation to the region C\ {k ∈ Z : k ≤ r}.

Proof. We first recall the following expansion of the harmonic numbers (see
for example [2, Eq. (2)])


P 2k+1 (x)

with ⌊x⌋ being the largest integer ≤ x.
Considering the well-known relation ψ (n)+γ = H n−1 for n ∈ N, (6) becomes

n [r]
h [(] n [r][)] = nΓ (r) [(][H] [n][+][r][−][1] [ −] [ψ][ (][r][)][ −] [γ][)][ .] (9)

For Re (s) = σ > r, from (8) and (9), we deduce the following representation
for ζ h (r) (s):

1
ζ h (r) (s) = − Γ (r) [ζ] [′] [ (][s][ + 1][ −] [r][)][ −] [ψ] Γ ( [ (] r [r] ) [)] [ζ][ (][s][ + 1][ −] [r][)]

Therefore R (s, k, j) is analytic in the half-plane σ > r−2k−1, and (10) provides
the analytic continuation of ζ h (r) (s) in the half-plane σ > r − 2k − 1.
It is seen from (10) that the singularities of ζ h (r) (s) arise from the poles of
1
ζ [′] (s + 1 − j), ζ (s + 1 − j), [�] [∞] n=1 n [s][−][j] (n+v) [and][ ζ][ (][s][ + 1][ −] [j][ + 2][m][).]
For r > 0 there is a second-order pole at s = r arising from the term
− 1
Γ(r) [ζ] [′] [ (][s][ + 1][ −] [r][)][ −] [ψ] Γ( [(] r [r] ) [)] [ζ][ (][s][ + 1][ −] [r][) with residue][ −] [ψ] Γ( [(] r [r] ) [)] [. Moreover, there are]

−
Γ(r) [ζ] [′] [ (][s][ + 1][ −] [r][)][ −] Γ(r) [ζ][ (][s][ + 1][ −] [r][) with residue][ −] Γ(r) [. Moreover, there are]

second-order poles at s = j for 1 ≤ j ≤ r − 1, and simple poles at s = j − 2m
with j − 2m < 1 for 1 ≤ j ≤ r and 1 ≤ m ≤ k . Since k is an arbitrary positive
integer, this implies that ζ h (r) (s) has a simple pole at every non-positive integer.


Remark 2 Interested readers can find the residues of ζ h (r) (s) at s = k, k ∈ Z
with k < r in [24, Theorem 1.1]. However, there are little misprints; the factors
r! in equations (1.6), (1.7) and (1.8) of [24, Theorem 1.1] should be (r − 1)!.

### 3 Laurent expansion and hyperharmonic Stielt- jes constants

### 4 Alternative representations for hyperharmonic Stieltjes constants

Recall that γ h (r) (m) reduces to γ (m) for r = 0. Now we are going to analyze
the case r > 0 in the following theorems.

Theorem 8 Let m be a non-negative integer and r be a positive integer. Then,


ζ [(][m][)] (r + 1 − j),
�


1 1

γ h (r+1) (m) = [1] r [γ] [h] [(][r][)] [ (][m][)][−] rΓ (r + 1) [γ][ (][m][)+][ζ] h [(][m] [(][r] [)] [)] [ (][r][ + 1)][−] rΓ (r + 1)

where ζ h [(][m] [(][r][)] [)] [ (][r][ + 1) =][ d] [m][m]


ds [d] [m][m] [ ζ][ (][s][)] ���� s=r .


Proof. We employ the following equation [20, Proposition 3]

Now we are going to give a representation for the constants γ h (r) (m) in
terms of Stieltjes constants γ H (m), γ (m) and some other special values related
to the Riemann zeta function. For this purpose we need the following lemma:

We conclude the paper with result on evaluation of the integrals involving
generalized exponential function.

Euler-Mascheroni constant γ, Stieltjes constant γ (1) and the constants σ k .

Proof. In special case m = 0, the constants γ h [∗] [(][r][)] [ (0) reduce to the constants]

can be written in terms of zeta values, Euler-Mascheroni constant and harmonic
numbers. To achieve this we appeal the following expression [10, Lemma 4]:

We now utilize the asymptotic expression (cf. (8))

for p ∈ N\ {1} . Combining (19) and (20) we accomplish that the constants γ h (r)
can be written in terms of zeta values, Euler-Mascheroni constant and harmonic
numbers.
Therefore it can be seen from (18), (19) and (20) that integrals involving
E p [0] [(][t][) can be written in terms of some special constants which is the assertion]
of Theorem 13.

Remark 14 1) It follows from (19) and (20) that the constants γ h (r) can be
explicitly written as
