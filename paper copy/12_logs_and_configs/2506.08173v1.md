**Abstract**

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
code generation and comprehension, yet their application to complex software engineering tasks often suffers from low precision and
limited interpretability. We present **Repeton** [1], a fully open-source
framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code
manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating
holistic fixes, **Repeton** operates through a structured patch-andtest pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes,
and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise
process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools,
avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated
on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity
and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks
into modular, verifiable stages, **Repeton** provides a practical path
toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.

**1** **Introduction**

Software debugging remains one of the most labor-intensive and
cognitively demanding tasks in software development. As codebases grow in size and complexity, diagnosing and fixing bugs
increasingly requires deep domain knowledge, iterative testing,
and contextual reasoning. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to automate parts of
this process. LLMs have demonstrated strong performance in code
generation, understanding, and repair, improving agents’ ability in
automating debugging workflows. However, many pipelines and
frameworks in software debugging are closed-source or rely on
closed-source LLMs, which restricts the development of this field
and causes problems such as the inability to deploy the pipeline
locally.
In this work, we introduce a fully open-source debugging agent
designed to overcome these limitations through a modular, embeddingfree pipeline that uses completely open-source LLMs solely for
structured reasoning. Instead of relying on closed-source LLM, our
system guides the agent through a step-by-step process inspired by
how developers debug: understanding and summarizing the problem, reproducing errors, narrowing the search space with keyword
heuristics, identifying suspect files and functions, and iteratively
generating and testing patches. This pipeline, illustrated in Figure 1,
organizes the agent’s reasoning in a transparent and interpretable
way, combining static inspection with runtime feedback.
Our approach focuses on practicality and efficiency. It avoids
neural embeddings and external retrieval systems, such as some
existing open-weight methods, instead using symbolic techniques
such as keyword extraction, structured file search, and test-driven
validation. This reduces the complexity of the framework and also
reduces the time to embed the entire codebase while still being
flexible enough to handle diverse software projects. After that, to
evaluate our system, we use SWE-bench Lite, a benchmark of realworld GitHub issues that require multi-file reasoning and test-based
validation, to assess and compare our method with some existing
open-weight solutions. Our results show that the proposed agent
performs well compared to solely RAG-based methods despite being unable to surpass SweFixer. Lastly, we analyze failure cases
of our framework, which can provide useful information for further research in this field. This work provides a reproducible and
transparent foundation for building autonomous debugging agents.
All components, including model weights, pipeline code, and evaluation scripts, are open-sourced to support further research and
real-world adoption.

**2** **Related Works**

Rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to
the emergence of coding agents, systems that go beyond simple
code generation to engage in autonomous software development
tasks. Models like Codex [ 3 ] and CodeT5+ [ 10 ] demonstrate strong
performance on code completion and synthesis benchmarks, while
frameworks such as GPT-Engineer [ 9 ] and Auto-GPT [ 13 ] showcase
the potential of chaining LLM actions to build software from natural
language specifications. However, these systems typically target
isolated or synthetic tasks and struggle to handle the complexity
of real-world software projects that require multistep reasoning,
context tracking, tool usage, and iterative testing.
This gap has raised interest in building autonomous agents that
can perform end-to-end bug fixing across entire codebases. Rather
than just generating snippets, these agents can identify relevant
files, interpret issues, locate faults, and fix the problem. In response
to this broader challenge, previous work explores a spectrum of
methods and tools. Classical approaches in automated program
repair (APR) separate fault localization from patch generation, using
techniques such as spectrum-based analysis, mutation testing, and
symbolic synthesis (e.g., GenProg [ 4 ], Angelix [ 8 ]). Learning-based
methods treat repair as translation from buggy code to fixed code,
but often fail to generalize beyond training distributions.
More recent systems adopt agentic architectures to coordinate
these steps. SWE-agent [ 14 ] and FixAgent [ 6 ] organize specialized
agents based on LLM (e.g., bug explainer, fault locator, patch proposer) that collaboratively solve debugging tasks. RepairAgent [ 2 ]
and AutoCodeRover [ 16 ] treat the LLM as a high-level planner that
invokes tools such as search, compilation, and testing. VulDebugger [ 7 ] combines dynamic run-time information with LLMs to guide
security patching. These systems show that agentic design enables


more robust debugging, especially when combined with static and
dynamic analysis.
To rigorously evaluate such agents, benchmarks such as the
SWE benchmark [ 5 ] have emerged as critical infrastructure. Derived from real GitHub issues and pull requests, SWE-bench tests
agents on realistic bug-fixing tasks involving complex, multi-file
projects and test-driven validation. It has become the standard
benchmark for assessing autonomous repair agents, with a curated
subset (SWE-bench Lite) introduced for efficient experimentation.
Performance in the SWE benchmark reveals the limitations of mand

LLMs, with top models solving only a fraction of cases, highlighting
the challenge of scaling debugging to real-world codebases.
Given these challenges, open-source software agents have become increasingly important. SWE-Fixer [ 12 ], built on InternLM,
demonstrates competitive performance using structured prompting, memory modules, and tool-augmented reasoning without relying on closed APIs. Moatless Tools [ 1 ] emphasizes simplicity and
reproducibility, offering lightweight, interpretable primitives for
debugging without embedding-heavy infrastructure. Our approach
shares this open, modular philosophy that extends it with runtime feedback loops and symbolic heuristics to minimize inference
overhead. The SWE-agent project [ 14 ] further exemplifies open
innovation, allowing LLMs to autonomously fix GitHub issues with
pluggable model backends, achieving strong results with models
like LLaMA-32B. In contrast, proprietary systems like Cognition
Labs’ Devin [ 11 ] remain closed-source, despite their reported performance (13.9% on SWE-bench). As such, open-source debugging
agents not only promote transparency and reproducibility but are
essential for democratizing progress in AI-assisted software engineering. Our work builds on this ethos, advancing fully open agents
for practical, scalable, and interpretable automated debugging.

Repeton: Structured Bug Repair with ReAct-Guided Patch-and-Test Cycles Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA


**3** **Methods**

This section introduces **Repeton**, a framework powered by the
Large Language Model (LLM) designed for the rectification of autonomous and precise codes.

**3.1** **Iterative Repair and Validation (IRV)**

The Iterative Repair and Validation (IRV) process represents the
core _patch-and-test_ strategy of **Repeton**, orchestrated through the
Testing and Patching modules. The process begins by summarizing the reported issue using a large language model (LLM), which
distills the original problem description into a concise summary
denoted _𝑃_ sum . This summary serves as a guiding context for both
patch generation and testing.
The Testing module uses a ReAct-style [ 15 ] reasoning flow to
iteratively build a test program that can reproduce the reported bug.
Using both the original problem description and its summary, it
generates a verifiable test case. Although the module also provides
feedback on the current patch and development state later on, its
main goal at this stage is to produce a consistently failing test that
confirms the presence of the bug. Once the test is generated, it is
executed, and the results are analyzed. If the test passes, indicating
that the bug is resolved and the patch does not negatively impact
the project, the current patch is finalized, and the process stops. If
the test fails, the system evaluates whether the failure is due to an
invalid test or an unresolved bug. Based on this, it either refines
the test or produces a diagnostic report with logs and suggestions
for further debugging. Throughout the process, the system also
considers the current patch state to assess how each change affects
the bug and the overall functionality, guiding whether to continue
with the current patching method or to find a new solution.
To support automated repair, the Patching module implements
the **Iterative Code Search and Repair** (ICSR) process. This multistep framework searches for candidate fixes and applies them
iteratively. Crucially, ICSR supports rollback capabilities, allowing
the system to revisit earlier stages and explore alternative strategies
when the current direction is found to be ineffective or suboptimal.

**3.2** **Iterative Code Search and Repair Process**
**(ICSR)**

The patching module is designed to methodically identify and apply
minimal modifications necessary to resolve a reported issue. This
process is organized into four sequential stages: identifying relevant
files, summarizing their structure, locating precise code regions, and
generating a patch. Initially, the agent extracts a list of keywords
based on both the problem description and the project’s directory
structure. These keywords are then used to query the project tree for
potentially relevant files. The resulting matches are displayed in a
tree-like format as shown in Figure 2, allowing the agent to visualize
the layout of the codebase. Furthermore, the agent can reassess
its choices and backtrack to refine the keyword list, leveraging
feedback from previous attempts to improve the relevance of the
search.
Upon identifying the appropriate files, the agent proceeds to
summarize the structure of each file by listing its classes, functions,
and their respective line spans. This structural overview helps the
agent reason about file content without parsing the full code in one


pass. Using this high-level map, the agent then inspects the internal content of specific classes and functions, enabling the precise
localization of potential bug sites. If the existing implementation
appears correct or irrelevant to the issue, the agent can shift its
focus to alternative files or code regions using the system-provided
tools. Importantly, edits are made conservatively: only one code
region is modified per iteration, and viewing a different file resets
all prior modifications to ensure patches remain minimal.
The agent follows a strictly linear process, advancing to the next
stage only after completing the current one. However, many stages
include a rollback mechanism to handle flawed decisions, such as
incorrect keyword selection or file relevance. In such cases, the
agent explains the mismatch between expectations and outcomes
and justifies revisiting an earlier stage with improved criteria. This
adaptive correction improves the robustness of the patching strategy without disrupting the structured workflow. Furthermore, the
entire process is guided by React-style prompting, where reasoning
and actions are tightly coupled at each step. A persistent problem
summary is included in all prompts to maintain focus, and a truncation mechanism retains only the most recent exchanges to prevent
history overload. When rolling back, the conversation history is
trimmed to that point, removing later interactions. Reflective feedback is essential for explaining failures and planning improvements,
avoiding repeated mistakes, and making informed decisions.

**Table 1: Performance comparison on the Swebench-lite**

**cessfully fixed.**

We evaluated our pipeline on the **Swebench-lite** benchmark
and compared it with other open-weight coding agents. Swebenchlite includes 300 GitHub repositories with real-world software bugs
and is widely used to assess automated software engineering systems. The target is to generate code patches that fix the reported
issues. We compare our method against two open-weight baselines:
Moatless Tools + DeepSeekV3 and Swe-Fixer . Swe-Fixer is
trained and fine-tuned specifically for Swebench-style bug fixing
and uses an additional text retrieval module to enhance patch quality, though this adds complexity and reduces efficiency. Our method,
in contrast, uses only general-purpose, open-weight models such
as DeepSeek, without task-specific tuning or retrieval components.
As shown in Table 1, our system achieves a success rate of 11.67%,
outperforming Moatless Tools + DeepSeekV3, which failed to
resolve any of the benchmark tasks. Although Swe-Fixer achieves
a higher overall success rate, our pipeline demonstrates competitive
performance, particularly considering its minimal architectural
assumptions and the lack of specialized fine-tuning.

|Col1|Resolved Unresolved Empty Patch Total|
|---|---|
|# Instances|35 113 152 300|



**Table 2: Summary of model outcomes. Many failures are due**
**to the agent not generating any patch content.**

We analyze the failure cases of our method using DeepSeek-R1,
as summarized in Table 2. One major issue is that the model sometimes does not generate any patch. This often happens when the
agent produces an overly long reasoning sequence, which causes it
to run out of context and stop before producing a final answer. This
highlights a risk when using general-purpose reasoning models
such as DeepSeek-R1 in this type of task.
Another common failure is the agent’s inability to identify the
correct files. This results in repeated unsuccessful searches without
any code modifications, revealing a weakness in the pipeline’s
ability to guide the agent effectively. In some cases, the agent also


fails to reproduce the reported error. Since the pipeline relies on
successful error reproduction to validate patches, this can cause
multiple valid patches to be rejected. Eventually, only the last patch
is accepted by default, even though earlier patches are often more
correct. This behavior can significantly reduce overall performance.

**6** **Conclusion**

We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework for autonomous
software debugging. Unlike monolithic LLM-based systems, Repeton
structures the debugging process as a modular patch-and-test pipeline,
enabling precise, interpretable, and verifiable code edits in realworld coding projects or repositories. By combining open-source
LLM reasoning with symbolic heuristics and developer tools, Repeton
efficiently navigates and modifies codebases. This research also examines cases where the pipeline failed to resolve issues, providing
a valuable resource for future development in this field. Finally,
Repeton offers a practical and extensible foundation for LLM-driven
software agents, prioritizing transparency and real-world applicability.

If you have published with ACM before, this document provides
insight and instruction into more recent changes to the article
template.
The “ acmart ” document class can be used to prepare articles for
any ACM publication — conference or journal, and for any stage
of publication, from review to final “camera-ready” copy, to the
author’s own version, with _very_ few changes to the source.


**2** **Template Overview**

As noted in the introduction, the “ acmart ” document class can be
used to prepare many different kinds of documentation — a doubleanonymous initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a
two-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a “cameraready” journal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more — all
by selecting the appropriate _template style_ and _template parameters_ .
This document will explain the major features of the document
class. For further information, the _L_ _[A]_ _T_ _E_ _X User’s Guide_ is available
from https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.

**2.1** **Template Styles**

The primary parameter given to the “ acmart ” document class is the
_template style_ which corresponds to the kind of publication or SIG
publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square brackets
and is a part of the documentclass command:

\documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}

Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM
journals use the acmsmall template style:

  - acmsmall: The default journal template style.

  - acmlarge: Used by JOCCH and TAP.

  - acmtog: Used by TOG.

The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use
the acmconf template style.

  - sigconf: The default proceedings template style.

  - sigchi: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.

  - sigplan: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.

**2.2** **Template Parameters**

In addition to specifying the _template style_ to be used in formatting
your work, there are a number of _template parameters_ which modify
some part of the applied template style. A complete list of these
parameters can be found in the _L_ _[A]_ _TEX User’s Guide._
Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:

  - anonymous,review : Suitable for a “double-anonymous” conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes
line numbers. Use with the \acmSubmissionID command to

print the submission’s unique ID on each page of the work.

  - authorversion : Produces a version of the work suitable for

posting by the author.

  - screen: Produces colored hyperlinks.

This document uses the following string as the first command
in the source file:

\documentclass[sigconf,authordraft]{acmart}


**4** **Typefaces**

The “ acmart ” document class requires the use of the “Libertine”
typeface family. Your T E X installation should include this set of
packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The “ lmodern ”
and “ ltimes ” packages should not be used, as they will override
the built-in typeface families.

**5** **Title Information**

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately https://capitalizemytitle.com/ has useful rules for capitalization.
Use the title command to define the title of your work. If your
work has a subtitle, define it with the subtitle command. Do not
insert line breaks in your title.
If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be
used in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The title
command has a “short title” parameter:

\title[short title]{full title}

**6**
**Authors and Affiliations**

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata identification. As an exception, multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors’ names should not be abbreviated; use full first names
wherever possible. Include authors’ e-mail addresses whenever
possible.
Grouping authors’ names or e-mail addresses, or providing an
“e-mail alias,” as shown below, is not acceptable:

\author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
\email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
\email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}

The authornote and authornotemark commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors — for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.
If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version
of the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just
after the last \author{} definition:

\renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}

Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of
all of the authors’ names, which may result in overlapping text in
the page headers.
The article template’s documentation, available at https://www.
acm.org/publications/proceedings-template, has a complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective use.
Note that authors’ addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

**7** **Rights Information**


Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a
rights form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice made by the author, this may be copyright transfer,
permission, license, or an OA (open access) agreement.
Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will
receive a copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This form contains L [A] T E X commands that must be copied
into the source document. When the document source is compiled,
these commands and their parameters add formatted text to several
areas of the final document:

  - the “ACM Reference Format” text on the first page.

  - the “rights management” text on the first page.

  - the conference information in the page header(s).

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing
several works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of

commands with each of the works.

The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over
one page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

**8**
**CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords**

Two elements of the “acmart” document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.
The ACM Computing Classification System — https://www.acm.
org/publications/class-2012 — is a set of classifiers and concepts
that describe the computing discipline. Authors can select entries
from this classification system, via https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm,
and generate the commands to be included in the L [A] TEX source.
User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and
phrases of the authors’ choosing, providing a more flexible way of
describing the research being presented.
CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for
all articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts).

**9** **Sectioning Commands**

Your work should use standard L [A] T E X sectioning commands: \section,
\subsection, \subsubsection, \paragraph, and \subparagraph .
The sectioning levels up to \subsusection should be numbered;
do not remove the numbering from the commands.
Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or
words of a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is **not allowed.**
Below are examples of sectioning commands.

**9.1** **Subsection**

This is a subsection.

_9.1.1_ _Subsubsection._ This is a subsubsection.

_Paragraph._ This is a paragraph.
Subparagraph This is a subparagraph.

**10** **Tables**

The “ acmart ” document class includes the “ booktabs ” package —
https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs — for preparing high-quality tables.

2025-06-15 05:01. Page 3 of 1–5.


**Table 1: Frequency of Special Characters**

Non-English or Math Frequency Comments

Ø 1 in 1,000 For Swedish names

_𝜋_ 1 in 5 Common in math

$ 4 in 5 Used in business
Ψ 1 [2] 1 in 40,000 Unexplained usage

Table captions are placed _above_ the table.
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement
for them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.
To ensure this proper “floating” placement of tables, use the environment **table** to enclose the table’s contents and the table caption.
The contents of the table itself must go in the **tabular** environment,
to be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules. Again, detailed instructions on **tabular**
material are found in the _L_ _[A]_ _TEX User’s Guide_ .
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which Table 1
is included in the input file; compare the placement of the table
here with the table in the printed output of this document.
To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page’s
live area, use the environment **table*** to enclose the table’s contents
and the table caption. As with a single-column table, this wide
table will “float” to a location deemed more desirable. Immediately
following this sentence is the point at which Table 2 is included in
the input file; again, it is instructive to compare the placement of
the table here with the table in the printed output of this document.
Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows,
and use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies
to recognise table headers and support their users in navigating
tables more easily.

**11** **Math Equations**

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display. Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

**11.1** **Inline (In-text) Equations**

A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula. It is produced by the **math** environment, which
can be invoked with the usual \begin . . . \end construction or
with the short form $ . . . $ . You can use any of the symbols and
structures, from _𝛼_ to _𝜔_, available in L [A] T E X [ **?** ]; this section will
simply show a few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice
how this equation: lim _𝑛_ →∞ _𝑥_ = 0, set here in in-line math style,
looks slightly different when set in display style. (See next section).

**11.2** **Display Equations**

A numbered display equation—one set off by vertical space from
the text and centered horizontally—is produced by the **equation**
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
**displaymath** environment.
Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in L [A] T E X; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context. First, consider the

to someone who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine
crawlers for indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.
A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than
2000 characters long (including spaces). **Figure descriptions should**
**not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture**
**important information that is not already provided in the**
**caption or the main text of the paper.** For figures that convey important and complex new information, a short text description may not be adequate. More complex alternative descriptions
can be placed in an appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example, provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a structured list representing a graph.
For additional information regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is so important, please see https:
//www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/.

**12.1** **The “Teaser Figure”**

A “teaser figure” is an image, or set of images in one figure, that are
placed after all author and affiliation information, and before the
body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\maketitle command:

\begin{teaserfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
\caption{figure caption}
\Description{figure description}
\end{teaserfigure}

**13** **Citations and Bibliographies**

The use of BibT E X for the preparation and formatting of one’s
references is strongly recommended. Authors’ names should be
complete — use full first names (“Donald E. Knuth”) not initials
(“D. E. Knuth”) — and the salient identifying features of a reference
should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages, article DOI,

etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these
two commands, placed just before the \end{document} command:

\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{bibfile}

where “ bibfile ” is the name, without the “ .bib ” suffix, of the
BibTEX file.
Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of ACM publications have citations and references formatted in
the “author year” style; for these exceptions, please include this command in the **preamble** (before the command “ \begin{document} ”)
of your L [A] TEX source:

\citestyle{acmauthoryear}

2025-06-15 05:01. Page 4 of 1–5.


just to demonstrate L [A] TEX’s able handling of numbering.

**12** **Figures**

The “ figure ” environment should be used for figures. One or more
images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains thirdparty material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown in the
example below.

**Figure 2: 1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Har-**
**ris & Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons.**
**(https://goo.gl/VLCRBB).**

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure
to the reader.
Figure captions are placed _below_ the figure.
Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is
purely decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image

**14** **Acknowledgments**

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks
to individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:

\begin{acks}

...

\end{acks}

so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.
Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered \section; please use the “acks” environment.

**15** **Appendices**

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the “ \end{document} ”
command at the conclusion of your source document.
Start the appendix with the “appendix” command:

\appendix

and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not numbered.
This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section and
subsection identification method.

**16** **Multi-language papers**

Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as
a rule, a paper in a language other than English should include
an English title and an English abstract). Use language=... for
every language used in the paper. The last language indicated is
the main language of the paper. For example, a French paper with

2025-06-15 05:01. Page 5 of 1–5.


additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start
with the following command

\documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
language=french]{acmart}

The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the
main language of the paper. The commands \translatedXXX, XXX
begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
in the other languages. The environment translatedabstract
is used to set the translation of the abstract. These commands
and environment have a mandatory first argument: the language
of the second argument. See sample-sigconf-i13n.tex file for
examples of their usage.

**17** **SIGCHI Extended Abstracts**

The “ sigchi-a ” template style (available only in L [A] T E X and not in
Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with a
wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with
the “ sigchi-a ” template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:

**sidebar:** Place formatted text in the margin.
**marginfigure:** Place a figure in the margin.
**margintable:** Place a table in the margin.

**1** **Introduction**

ACM’s consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides
a consistent L [A] T E X style for use across ACM publications, and incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and
SIG-specific L [A] T E X templates have been examined, and their unique
features incorporated into this single new template.
If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a
valuable guide to the process of preparing your work for publication.
If you have published with ACM before, this document provides
insight and instruction into more recent changes to the article
template.
The “ acmart ” document class can be used to prepare articles for
any ACM publication — conference or journal, and for any stage


of publication, from review to final “camera-ready” copy, to the
author’s own version, with _very_ few changes to the source.

**2** **Template Overview**

As noted in the introduction, the “ acmart ” document class can be
used to prepare many different kinds of documentation — a doubleanonymous initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a
two-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a “cameraready” journal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more — all
by selecting the appropriate _template style_ and _template parameters_ .
This document will explain the major features of the document
class. For further information, the _L_ _[A]_ _T_ _E_ _X User’s Guide_ is available
from https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.

**2.1** **Template Styles**

The primary parameter given to the “ acmart ” document class is the
_template style_ which corresponds to the kind of publication or SIG
publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square brackets
and is a part of the documentclass command:

\documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}

Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM
journals use the acmsmall template style:

  - acmsmall: The default journal template style.

  - acmlarge: Used by JOCCH and TAP.

  - acmtog: Used by TOG.

The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use
the acmconf template style.

  - sigconf: The default proceedings template style.

  - sigchi: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.

  - sigplan: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.

**2.2** **Template Parameters**

In addition to specifying the _template style_ to be used in formatting
your work, there are a number of _template parameters_ which modify
some part of the applied template style. A complete list of these
parameters can be found in the _L_ _[A]_ _TEX User’s Guide._
Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:

  - anonymous,review : Suitable for a “double-anonymous” conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes
line numbers. Use with the \acmSubmissionID command to

print the submission’s unique ID on each page of the work.

  - authorversion : Produces a version of the work suitable for

posting by the author.

  - screen: Produces colored hyperlinks.

This document uses the following string as the first command
in the source file:

\documentclass[sigconf, language=french,
language=german, language=spanish, language=english]{acmart}

**3**
**Modifications**

Modifying the template — including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,

The Name of the Title Is Hope Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY


and the use of the \vspace command to manually adjust the vertical
spacing between elements of your work — is not allowed.
**Your document will be returned to you for revision if mod-**
**ifications are discovered.**

**4** **Typefaces**

The “ acmart ” document class requires the use of the “Libertine”
typeface family. Your T E X installation should include this set of
packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The “ lmodern ”
and “ ltimes ” packages should not be used, as they will override
the built-in typeface families.

**5** **Title Information**

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately https://capitalizemytitle.com/ has useful rules for capitalization.
Use the title command to define the title of your work. If your
work has a subtitle, define it with the subtitle command. Do not
insert line breaks in your title.
If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be
used in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The title
command has a “short title” parameter:

\title[short title]{full title}

**6**
**Authors and Affiliations**

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata identification. As an exception, multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors’ names should not be abbreviated; use full first names
wherever possible. Include authors’ e-mail addresses whenever
possible.
Grouping authors’ names or e-mail addresses, or providing an
“e-mail alias,” as shown below, is not acceptable:

\author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
\email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
\email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}

The authornote and authornotemark commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors — for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.
If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version
of the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just
after the last \author{} definition:

\renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}

Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of
all of the authors’ names, which may result in overlapping text in
the page headers.
The article template’s documentation, available at https://www.
acm.org/publications/proceedings-template, has a complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective use.
Note that authors’ addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

**7** **Rights Information**

Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a
rights form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice made by the author, this may be copyright transfer,
permission, license, or an OA (open access) agreement.


Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will
receive a copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This form contains L [A] T E X commands that must be copied
into the source document. When the document source is compiled,
these commands and their parameters add formatted text to several
areas of the final document:

  - the “ACM Reference Format” text on the first page.

  - the “rights management” text on the first page.

  - the conference information in the page header(s).

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing
several works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of

commands with each of the works.

The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over
one page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

**8**
**CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords**

Two elements of the “acmart” document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.
The ACM Computing Classification System — https://www.acm.
org/publications/class-2012 — is a set of classifiers and concepts
that describe the computing discipline. Authors can select entries
from this classification system, via https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm,
and generate the commands to be included in the L [A] TEX source.
User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and
phrases of the authors’ choosing, providing a more flexible way of
describing the research being presented.
CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for
all articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts).

**9** **Sectioning Commands**

Your work should use standard L [A] T E X sectioning commands: \section,
\subsection, \subsubsection, \paragraph, and \subparagraph .
The sectioning levels up to \subsusection should be numbered;
do not remove the numbering from the commands.
Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or
words of a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is **not allowed.**
Below are examples of sectioning commands.

**9.1** **Subsection**

This is a subsection.

_9.1.1_ _Subsubsection._ This is a subsubsection.

_Paragraph._ This is a paragraph.
Subparagraph This is a subparagraph.

**10** **Tables**

The “ acmart ” document class includes the “ booktabs ” package —
https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs — for preparing high-quality tables.
Table captions are placed _above_ the table.
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement
for them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.
To ensure this proper “floating” placement of tables, use the environment **table** to enclose the table’s contents and the table caption.

Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.


**Table 1: Frequency of Special Characters**

Non-English or Math Frequency Comments

Ø 1 in 1,000 For Swedish names

_𝜋_ 1 in 5 Common in math

$ 4 in 5 Used in business
Ψ 1 [2] 1 in 40,000 Unexplained usage

The contents of the table itself must go in the **tabular** environment,
to be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules. Again, detailed instructions on **tabular**
material are found in the _L_ _[A]_ _TEX User’s Guide_ .
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which Table 1
is included in the input file; compare the placement of the table
here with the table in the printed output of this document.
To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page’s
live area, use the environment **table*** to enclose the table’s contents
and the table caption. As with a single-column table, this wide
table will “float” to a location deemed more desirable. Immediately
following this sentence is the point at which Table 2 is included in
the input file; again, it is instructive to compare the placement of
the table here with the table in the printed output of this document.
Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows,
and use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies
to recognise table headers and support their users in navigating
tables more easily.

**11** **Math Equations**

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display. Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

**11.1** **Inline (In-text) Equations**

A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula. It is produced by the **math** environment, which
can be invoked with the usual \begin . . . \end construction or
with the short form $ . . . $ . You can use any of the symbols and
structures, from _𝛼_ to _𝜔_, available in L [A] T E X [ **?** ]; this section will
simply show a few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice
how this equation: lim _𝑛_ →∞ _𝑥_ = 0, set here in in-line math style,
looks slightly different when set in display style. (See next section).

**11.2** **Display Equations**

A numbered display equation—one set off by vertical space from
the text and centered horizontally—is produced by the **equation**
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
**displaymath** environment.
Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in L [A] T E X; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context. First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:

lim (1)
_𝑛_ →∞ _[𝑥]_ [=][ 0]


Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in the **display-**
**math** environment. Now, we’ll enter an unnumbered equation:

∞

_𝑥_ + 1

∑︁

_𝑖_ =0

and follow it with another numbered equation:


∑︁ ∞


_𝑓_ (2)
0


∞ _𝜋_ +2

_𝑥_ _𝑖_ =

∑︁ _𝑖_ =0 ∫ 0


just to demonstrate L [A] TEX’s able handling of numbering.

**12** **Figures**

The “ figure ” environment should be used for figures. One or more
images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains thirdparty material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown in the
example below.

**Figure 2: 1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Har-**
**ris & Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons.**
**(https://goo.gl/VLCRBB).**

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure
to the reader.
Figure captions are placed _below_ the figure.
Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is
purely decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image
to someone who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine
crawlers for indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.
A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than
2000 characters long (including spaces). **Figure descriptions should**
**not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture**
**important information that is not already provided in the**
**caption or the main text of the paper.** For figures that convey important and complex new information, a short text description may not be adequate. More complex alternative descriptions
can be placed in an appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example, provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a structured list representing a graph.

**Table 2: Some Typical Commands**

Command A Number Comments

\author 100 Author

\table 300 For tables

\table* 400 For wider tables


For additional information regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is so important, please see https:
//www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/.

**12.1** **The “Teaser Figure”**

A “teaser figure” is an image, or set of images in one figure, that are
placed after all author and affiliation information, and before the
body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\maketitle command:

\begin{teaserfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
\caption{figure caption}
\Description{figure description}
\end{teaserfigure}

**13** **Citations and Bibliographies**

The use of BibT E X for the preparation and formatting of one’s
references is strongly recommended. Authors’ names should be
complete — use full first names (“Donald E. Knuth”) not initials
(“D. E. Knuth”) — and the salient identifying features of a reference
should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages, article DOI,

etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these
two commands, placed just before the \end{document} command:

\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{bibfile}
where “ bibfile ” is the name, without the “ .bib ” suffix, of the
BibTEX file.
Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of ACM publications have citations and references formatted in
the “author year” style; for these exceptions, please include this command in the **preamble** (before the command “ \begin{document} ”)
of your L [A] TEX source:

\citestyle{acmauthoryear}

Some examples. A paginated journal article [ **?** ], an enumerated
journal article [ **?** ], a reference to an entire issue [ **?** ], a monograph
(whole book) [ **?** ], a monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a
in spec. document) [ **?** ], a divisible-book such as an anthology or
compilation [ **?** ] followed by the same example, however we only
output the series if the volume number is given [ **?** ] (so Editor00a’s
series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.), a chapter
in a divisible book [ **?** ], a chapter in a divisible book in a series

[ **?** ], a multi-volume work as book [ **?** ], a couple of articles in a
proceedings (of a conference, symposium, workshop for example)
(paginated proceedings article) [ **? ?** ], a proceedings article with all
possible elements [ **?** ], an example of an enumerated proceedings


article [ **?** ], an informally published work [ **?** ], a couple of preprints

[ **? ?** ], a doctoral dissertation [ **?** ], a master’s thesis: [ **?** ], an online
document / world wide web resource [ **? ? ?** ], a video game (Case
1) [ **?** ] and (Case 2) [ **?** ] and [ **?** ] and (Case 3) a patent [ **?** ], work
accepted for publication [ **?** ], ’YYYYb’-test for prolific author [ **?** ]
and [ **?** ]. Other cites might contain ’duplicate’ DOI and URLs (some
SIAM articles) [ **?** ]. Boris / Barbara Beeton: multi-volume works as
books [ **?** ] and [ **?** ]. A couple of citations with DOIs: [ **? ?** ]. Online
citations: [ **? ? ?** ]. Artifacts: [ **?** ] and [ **?** ].

**14** **Acknowledgments**

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks
to individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:

\begin{acks}

...

\end{acks}

so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.
Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered \section; please use the “acks” environment.

**15** **Appendices**

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the “ \end{document} ”
command at the conclusion of your source document.
Start the appendix with the “appendix” command:

\appendix

and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not numbered.
This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section and
subsection identification method.

**16** **Multi-language papers**

Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as
a rule, a paper in a language other than English should include
an English title and an English abstract). Use language=... for
every language used in the paper. The last language indicated is
the main language of the paper. For example, a French paper with
additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start
with the following command

\documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
language=french]{acmart}

Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.


The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the
main language of the paper. The commands \translatedXXX, XXX
begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
in the other languages. The environment translatedabstract
is used to set the translation of the abstract. These commands
and environment have a mandatory first argument: the language
of the second argument. See sample-sigconf-i13n.tex file for
examples of their usage.

**17** **SIGCHI Extended Abstracts**

The “ sigchi-a ” template style (available only in L [A] T E X and not in
Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with a
wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with
the “ sigchi-a ” template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:

**sidebar:** Place formatted text in the margin.
**marginfigure:** Place a figure in the margin.
**margintable:** Place a table in the margin.

If you have published with ACM before, this document provides
insight and instruction into more recent changes to the article
template.
The “ acmart ” document class can be used to prepare articles for
any ACM publication — conference or journal, and for any stage
of publication, from review to final “camera-ready” copy, to the

**2.1** **Template Styles**

The primary parameter given to the “ acmart ” document class is the
_template style_ which corresponds to the kind of publication or SIG
publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square brackets
and is a part of the documentclass command:

\documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}

**2.2** **Template Parameters**

In addition to specifying the _template style_ to be used in formatting
your work, there are a number of _template parameters_ which modify
some part of the applied template style. A complete list of these

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately https://capitalizemytitle.com/ has useful rules for capitalization.
Use the title command to define the title of your work. If your
work has a subtitle, define it with the subtitle command. Do not
insert line breaks in your title.
If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be
used in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The title
command has a “short title” parameter:

\title[short title]{full title}

**6**
**Authors and Affiliations**

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata identification. As an exception, multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors’ names should not be abbreviated; use full first names
wherever possible. Include authors’ e-mail addresses whenever
possible.
Grouping authors’ names or e-mail addresses, or providing an
“e-mail alias,” as shown below, is not acceptable:

\author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
\email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
\email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}

The authornote and authornotemark commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors — for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.
If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version
of the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just
after the last \author{} definition:

\renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}

Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of
all of the authors’ names, which may result in overlapping text in
the page headers.
The article template’s documentation, available at https://www.
acm.org/publications/proceedings-template, has a complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective use.
Note that authors’ addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

**7** **Rights Information**

Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a
rights form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice made by the author, this may be copyright transfer,
permission, license, or an OA (open access) agreement.
Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will
receive a copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This form contains L [A] T E X commands that must be copied
into the source document. When the document source is compiled,
these commands and their parameters add formatted text to several
areas of the final document:

  - the “ACM Reference Format” text on the first page.

  - the “rights management” text on the first page.

  - the conference information in the page header(s).

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing
several works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of

commands with each of the works.

The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over
one page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

**8**
**CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords**

Two elements of the “acmart” document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.
The ACM Computing Classification System — https://www.acm.
org/publications/class-2012 — is a set of classifiers and concepts
that describe the computing discipline. Authors can select entries
from this classification system, via https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm,
and generate the commands to be included in the L [A] TEX source.
User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and
phrases of the authors’ choosing, providing a more flexible way of
describing the research being presented.
CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for
all articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts).

**9** **Sectioning Commands**

Your work should use standard L [A] T E X sectioning commands: \section,
\subsection, \subsubsection, \paragraph, and \subparagraph .
The sectioning levels up to \subsusection should be numbered;
do not remove the numbering from the commands.
Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or
words of a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is **not allowed.**
Below are examples of sectioning commands.

**9.1** **Subsection**

This is a subsection.

_9.1.1_ _Subsubsection._ This is a subsubsection.

_Paragraph._ This is a paragraph.
Subparagraph This is a subparagraph.

**10** **Tables**

The “ acmart ” document class includes the “ booktabs ” package —
https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs — for preparing high-quality tables.


**Table 1: Frequency of Special Characters**

Non-English or Math Frequency Comments

Ø 1 in 1,000 For Swedish names

_𝜋_ 1 in 5 Common in math

$ 4 in 5 Used in business
Ψ 1 [2] 1 in 40,000 Unexplained usage

Table captions are placed _above_ the table.
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement
for them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.
To ensure this proper “floating” placement of tables, use the environment **table** to enclose the table’s contents and the table caption.
The contents of the table itself must go in the **tabular** environment,
to be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules. Again, detailed instructions on **tabular**
material are found in the _L_ _[A]_ _TEX User’s Guide_ .
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which Table 1
is included in the input file; compare the placement of the table
here with the table in the printed output of this document.
To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page’s
live area, use the environment **table*** to enclose the table’s contents
and the table caption. As with a single-column table, this wide
table will “float” to a location deemed more desirable. Immediately
following this sentence is the point at which Table 2 is included in
the input file; again, it is instructive to compare the placement of
the table here with the table in the printed output of this document.
Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows,
and use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies
to recognise table headers and support their users in navigating
tables more easily.

**11** **Math Equations**

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display. Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

**11.1** **Inline (In-text) Equations**

A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula. It is produced by the **math** environment, which
can be invoked with the usual \begin . . . \end construction or
with the short form $ . . . $ . You can use any of the symbols and
structures, from _𝛼_ to _𝜔_, available in L [A] T E X [ **?** ]; this section will
simply show a few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice
how this equation: lim _𝑛_ →∞ _𝑥_ = 0, set here in in-line math style,
looks slightly different when set in display style. (See next section).

**11.2** **Display Equations**

A numbered display equation—one set off by vertical space from
the text and centered horizontally—is produced by the **equation**
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
**displaymath** environment.
Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in L [A] T E X; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context. First, consider the

Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.

equation, shown as an inline equation above:

lim (1)
_𝑛_ →∞ _[𝑥]_ [=][ 0]

Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in the **display-**
**math** environment. Now, we’ll enter an unnumbered equation:

∞

_𝑥_ + 1

∑︁

_𝑖_ =0

and follow it with another numbered equation:

_𝑥_ _𝑖_ =

∑︁ _𝑖_ =0 ∫ 0


to someone who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine
crawlers for indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.
A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than
2000 characters long (including spaces). **Figure descriptions should**
**not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture**
**important information that is not already provided in the**
**caption or the main text of the paper.** For figures that convey important and complex new information, a short text description may not be adequate. More complex alternative descriptions
can be placed in an appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example, provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a structured list representing a graph.
For additional information regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is so important, please see https:
//www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/.

**12.1** **The “Teaser Figure”**

A “teaser figure” is an image, or set of images in one figure, that are
placed after all author and affiliation information, and before the
body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\maketitle command:

\begin{teaserfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
\caption{figure caption}
\Description{figure description}
\end{teaserfigure}

**13** **Citations and Bibliographies**

The use of BibT E X for the preparation and formatting of one’s
references is strongly recommended. Authors’ names should be
complete — use full first names (“Donald E. Knuth”) not initials
(“D. E. Knuth”) — and the salient identifying features of a reference
should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages, article DOI,

etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these
two commands, placed just before the \end{document} command:

\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{bibfile}

where “ bibfile ” is the name, without the “ .bib ” suffix, of the
BibTEX file.
Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of ACM publications have citations and references formatted in
the “author year” style; for these exceptions, please include this command in the **preamble** (before the command “ \begin{document} ”)
of your L [A] TEX source:

\citestyle{acmauthoryear}


just to demonstrate L [A] TEX’s able handling of numbering.

**12** **Figures**

The “ figure ” environment should be used for figures. One or more
images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains thirdparty material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown in the
example below.

**Figure 2: 1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Har-**
**ris & Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons.**
**(https://goo.gl/VLCRBB).**

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure
to the reader.
Figure captions are placed _below_ the figure.
Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is
purely decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image

**14** **Acknowledgments**

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks
to individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:

\begin{acks}

...

\end{acks}

so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.
Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered \section; please use the “acks” environment.

**15** **Appendices**

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the “ \end{document} ”
command at the conclusion of your source document.
Start the appendix with the “appendix” command:

\appendix

and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not numbered.
This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section and
subsection identification method.

**16** **Multi-language papers**

Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as
a rule, a paper in a language other than English should include
an English title and an English abstract). Use language=... for
every language used in the paper. The last language indicated is
the main language of the paper. For example, a French paper with


additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start
with the following command

\documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
language=french]{acmart}

The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the
main language of the paper. The commands \translatedXXX, XXX
begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
in the other languages. The environment translatedabstract
is used to set the translation of the abstract. These commands
and environment have a mandatory first argument: the language
of the second argument. See sample-sigconf-i13n.tex file for
examples of their usage.

**17** **SIGCHI Extended Abstracts**

The “ sigchi-a ” template style (available only in L [A] T E X and not in
Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with a
wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with
the “ sigchi-a ” template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:

**sidebar:** Place formatted text in the margin.
**marginfigure:** Place a figure in the margin.
**margintable:** Place a table in the margin.

**1** **Introduction**

ACM’s consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides
a consistent L [A] T E X style for use across ACM publications, and incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and
SIG-specific L [A] T E X templates have been examined, and their unique
features incorporated into this single new template.
If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a
valuable guide to the process of preparing your work for publication.

Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.


If you have published with ACM before, this document provides
insight and instruction into more recent changes to the article
template.
The “ acmart ” document class can be used to prepare articles for
any ACM publication — conference or journal, and for any stage
of publication, from review to final “camera-ready” copy, to the
author’s own version, with _very_ few changes to the source.

**2** **Template Overview**

As noted in the introduction, the “ acmart ” document class can be
used to prepare many different kinds of documentation — a doubleanonymous initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a
two-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a “cameraready” journal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more — all
by selecting the appropriate _template style_ and _template parameters_ .
This document will explain the major features of the document
class. For further information, the _L_ _[A]_ _T_ _E_ _X User’s Guide_ is available
from https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.

**2.1** **Template Styles**

The primary parameter given to the “ acmart ” document class is the
_template style_ which corresponds to the kind of publication or SIG
publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square brackets
and is a part of the documentclass command:

\documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}

Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM
journals use the acmsmall template style:

  - acmsmall: The default journal template style.

  - acmlarge: Used by JOCCH and TAP.

  - acmtog: Used by TOG.

The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use
the acmconf template style.

  - sigconf: The default proceedings template style.

  - sigchi: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.

  - sigplan: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.

**2.2** **Template Parameters**

In addition to specifying the _template style_ to be used in formatting
your work, there are a number of _template parameters_ which modify
some part of the applied template style. A complete list of these
parameters can be found in the _L_ _[A]_ _TEX User’s Guide._
Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:

  - anonymous,review : Suitable for a “double-anonymous” conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes
line numbers. Use with the \acmSubmissionID command to

print the submission’s unique ID on each page of the work.

  - authorversion : Produces a version of the work suitable for

posting by the author.

  - screen: Produces colored hyperlinks.

This document uses the following string as the first command
in the source file:

\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}


**3**
**Modifications**

Modifying the template — including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \vspace command to manually adjust the vertical
spacing between elements of your work — is not allowed.
**Your document will be returned to you for revision if mod-**
**ifications are discovered.**

**4** **Typefaces**

The “ acmart ” document class requires the use of the “Libertine”
typeface family. Your T E X installation should include this set of
packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The “ lmodern ”
and “ ltimes ” packages should not be used, as they will override
the built-in typeface families.

**5** **Title Information**

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately https://capitalizemytitle.com/ has useful rules for capitalization.
Use the title command to define the title of your work. If your
work has a subtitle, define it with the subtitle command. Do not
insert line breaks in your title.
If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be
used in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The title
command has a “short title” parameter:

\title[short title]{full title}

**6**
**Authors and Affiliations**

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata identification. As an exception, multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors’ names should not be abbreviated; use full first names
wherever possible. Include authors’ e-mail addresses whenever
possible.
Grouping authors’ names or e-mail addresses, or providing an
“e-mail alias,” as shown below, is not acceptable:

\author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
\email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
\email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}

The authornote and authornotemark commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors — for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.
If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version
of the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just
after the last \author{} definition:

\renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}

Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of
all of the authors’ names, which may result in overlapping text in
the page headers.
The article template’s documentation, available at https://www.
acm.org/publications/proceedings-template, has a complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective use.
Note that authors’ addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

**7** **Rights Information**

Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a
rights form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice made by the author, this may be copyright transfer,
permission, license, or an OA (open access) agreement.
Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will
receive a copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This form contains L [A] T E X commands that must be copied
into the source document. When the document source is compiled,
these commands and their parameters add formatted text to several
areas of the final document:

  - the “ACM Reference Format” text on the first page.

  - the “rights management” text on the first page.

  - the conference information in the page header(s).

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing
several works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of

commands with each of the works.

The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over
one page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

**8**
**CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords**

Two elements of the “acmart” document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.
The ACM Computing Classification System — https://www.acm.
org/publications/class-2012 — is a set of classifiers and concepts
that describe the computing discipline. Authors can select entries
from this classification system, via https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm,
and generate the commands to be included in the L [A] TEX source.
User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and
phrases of the authors’ choosing, providing a more flexible way of
describing the research being presented.
CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for
all articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts).

**9** **Sectioning Commands**

Your work should use standard L [A] T E X sectioning commands: \section,
\subsection, \subsubsection, \paragraph, and \subparagraph .
The sectioning levels up to \subsusection should be numbered;
do not remove the numbering from the commands.
Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or
words of a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is **not allowed.**
Below are examples of sectioning commands.

**9.1** **Subsection**

This is a subsection.

_9.1.1_ _Subsubsection._ This is a subsubsection.

_Paragraph._ This is a paragraph.
Subparagraph This is a subparagraph.

**10** **Tables**

The “ acmart ” document class includes the “ booktabs ” package —
https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs — for preparing high-quality tables.

**11** **Math Equations**

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display. Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

**11.1** **Inline (In-text) Equations**

A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula. It is produced by the **math** environment, which
can be invoked with the usual \begin . . . \end construction or
with the short form $ . . . $ . You can use any of the symbols and
structures, from _𝛼_ to _𝜔_, available in L [A] T E X [ **?** ]; this section will
simply show a few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice
how this equation: lim _𝑛_ →∞ _𝑥_ = 0, set here in in-line math style,
looks slightly different when set in display style. (See next section).

**11.2** **Display Equations**

A numbered display equation—one set off by vertical space from
the text and centered horizontally—is produced by the **equation**
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
**displaymath** environment.
Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in L [A] T E X; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context. First, consider the

Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.

to someone who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine
crawlers for indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.
A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than
2000 characters long (including spaces). **Figure descriptions should**
**not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture**
**important information that is not already provided in the**
**caption or the main text of the paper.** For figures that convey important and complex new information, a short text description may not be adequate. More complex alternative descriptions
can be placed in an appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example, provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a structured list representing a graph.
For additional information regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is so important, please see https:
//www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/.

**12.1** **The “Teaser Figure”**

A “teaser figure” is an image, or set of images in one figure, that are
placed after all author and affiliation information, and before the
body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\maketitle command:

\begin{teaserfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
\caption{figure caption}
\Description{figure description}
\end{teaserfigure}

**13** **Citations and Bibliographies**

The use of BibT E X for the preparation and formatting of one’s
references is strongly recommended. Authors’ names should be
complete — use full first names (“Donald E. Knuth”) not initials
(“D. E. Knuth”) — and the salient identifying features of a reference
should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages, article DOI,

etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these
two commands, placed just before the \end{document} command:

\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{bibfile}

where “ bibfile ” is the name, without the “ .bib ” suffix, of the
BibTEX file.
Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of ACM publications have citations and references formatted in
the “author year” style; for these exceptions, please include this command in the **preamble** (before the command “ \begin{document} ”)
of your L [A] TEX source:

\citestyle{acmauthoryear}


just to demonstrate L [A] TEX’s able handling of numbering.

**12** **Figures**

The “ figure ” environment should be used for figures. One or more
images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains thirdparty material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown in the
example below.

**Figure 2: 1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Har-**
**ris & Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons.**
**(https://goo.gl/VLCRBB).**

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure
to the reader.
Figure captions are placed _below_ the figure.
Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is
purely decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image

**14** **Acknowledgments**

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks
to individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:

\begin{acks}

...

\end{acks}

so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.
Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered \section; please use the “acks” environment.

**15** **Appendices**

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the “ \end{document} ”
command at the conclusion of your source document.
Start the appendix with the “appendix” command:

\appendix

and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not numbered.
This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section and
subsection identification method.

**16** **Multi-language papers**

Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as
a rule, a paper in a language other than English should include
an English title and an English abstract). Use language=... for
every language used in the paper. The last language indicated is
the main language of the paper. For example, a French paper with


additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start
with the following command

\documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
language=french]{acmart}

The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the
main language of the paper. The commands \translatedXXX, XXX
begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
in the other languages. The environment translatedabstract
is used to set the translation of the abstract. These commands
and environment have a mandatory first argument: the language
of the second argument. See sample-sigconf-i13n.tex file for
examples of their usage.

**17** **SIGCHI Extended Abstracts**

The “ sigchi-a ” template style (available only in L [A] T E X and not in
Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with a
wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with
the “ sigchi-a ” template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:

**sidebar:** Place formatted text in the margin.
**marginfigure:** Place a figure in the margin.
**margintable:** Place a table in the margin.

**1** **Introduction**

Software debugging remains one of the most time-consuming and
expertise-intensive tasks in the software development lifecycle.
While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and program analysis have opened up new possibilities for intelligent debugging agents, many existing approaches rely heavily on massive
embedding models or static prompting, limiting their efficiency,
transparency, and adaptability in real-world scenarios.
In this paper, we present a lightweight, modular software agent
capable of real-time debugging across diverse software projects
without the need for embedding-heavy components. Our method
structures the agent’s behavior as a stepwise reasoning pipeline that
mimics how experienced developers isolate, diagnose, and resolve
bugs. This pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1 and includes steps
such as reproducing the error, identifying relevant files and code
segments via keyword-based heuristics, and iteratively refining
fixes based on runtime feedback.

Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.


The agent operates by alternating between static reasoning and
dynamic feedback loops: it summarizes the problem, attempts to
reproduce the issue, and if a bug is confirmed, proceeds through
a systematic exploration of the codebase using keyword searches
and file-level filtering. This design allows it to locate and analyze
relevant code paths with minimal computational overhead. Once
candidate code regions are identified, the agent proposes and evaluates fixes through iterative testing, avoiding reliance on opaque
model predictions or brute-force code generation.
We fully open-source our implementation, including both the
pipeline logic and the model weights used for analysis and reasoning. Our system is tested on real-world open-source repositories
and demonstrates strong debugging performance, particularly in
settings where traditional LLM-based approaches struggle due to
scale or ambiguity. By enabling real-time, interpretable debugging,
our method bridges the gap between fully automated agents and
practical developer workflows.

**2** **Template Overview**

As noted in the introduction, the “ acmart ” document class can be
used to prepare many different kinds of documentation — a doubleanonymous initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a
two-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a “cameraready” journal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more — all
by selecting the appropriate _template style_ and _template parameters_ .
This document will explain the major features of the document
class. For further information, the _L_ _[A]_ _T_ _E_ _X User’s Guide_ is available
from https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.

**2.1** **Template Styles**

The primary parameter given to the “ acmart ” document class is the
_template style_ which corresponds to the kind of publication or SIG
publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square brackets
and is a part of the documentclass command:

\documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}

Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM
journals use the acmsmall template style:

  - acmsmall: The default journal template style.

  - acmlarge: Used by JOCCH and TAP.

  - acmtog: Used by TOG.

The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use
the acmconf template style.

  - sigconf: The default proceedings template style.

  - sigchi: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.

  - sigplan: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.

**2.2** **Template Parameters**

In addition to specifying the _template style_ to be used in formatting
your work, there are a number of _template parameters_ which modify
some part of the applied template style. A complete list of these
parameters can be found in the _L_ _[A]_ _TEX User’s Guide._
Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:

  - anonymous,review : Suitable for a “double-anonymous” conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes


line numbers. Use with the \acmSubmissionID command to

print the submission’s unique ID on each page of the work.

  - authorversion : Produces a version of the work suitable for

posting by the author.

  - screen: Produces colored hyperlinks.

This document uses the following string as the first command
in the source file:

\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}

**3**
**Modifications**

Modifying the template — including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \vspace command to manually adjust the vertical
spacing between elements of your work — is not allowed.
**Your document will be returned to you for revision if mod-**
**ifications are discovered.**

**4** **Typefaces**

The “ acmart ” document class requires the use of the “Libertine”
typeface family. Your T E X installation should include this set of
packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The “ lmodern ”
and “ ltimes ” packages should not be used, as they will override
the built-in typeface families.

**5** **Title Information**

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately https://capitalizemytitle.com/ has useful rules for capitalization.
Use the title command to define the title of your work. If your
work has a subtitle, define it with the subtitle command. Do not
insert line breaks in your title.
If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be
used in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The title
command has a “short title” parameter:

\title[short title]{full title}

**6**
**Authors and Affiliations**

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata identification. As an exception, multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors’ names should not be abbreviated; use full first names
wherever possible. Include authors’ e-mail addresses whenever
possible.
Grouping authors’ names or e-mail addresses, or providing an
“e-mail alias,” as shown below, is not acceptable:

\author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
\email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
\email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}

The authornote and authornotemark commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors — for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.
If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version
of the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just
after the last \author{} definition:

\renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}

Debuging agent Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY


Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of
all of the authors’ names, which may result in overlapping text in
the page headers.
The article template’s documentation, available at https://www.
acm.org/publications/proceedings-template, has a complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective use.
Note that authors’ addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

**7** **Rights Information**

Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a
rights form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice made by the author, this may be copyright transfer,
permission, license, or an OA (open access) agreement.
Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will
receive a copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This form contains L [A] T E X commands that must be copied
into the source document. When the document source is compiled,
these commands and their parameters add formatted text to several
areas of the final document:

  - the “ACM Reference Format” text on the first page.

  - the “rights management” text on the first page.

  - the conference information in the page header(s).

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing
several works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of

commands with each of the works.

The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over
one page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

**8**
**CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords**

Two elements of the “acmart” document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.
The ACM Computing Classification System — https://www.acm.
org/publications/class-2012 — is a set of classifiers and concepts
that describe the computing discipline. Authors can select entries
from this classification system, via https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm,
and generate the commands to be included in the L [A] TEX source.
User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and
phrases of the authors’ choosing, providing a more flexible way of
describing the research being presented.
CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for
all articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts).

**9** **Sectioning Commands**

Your work should use standard L [A] T E X sectioning commands: \section,
\subsection, \subsubsection, \paragraph, and \subparagraph .
The sectioning levels up to \subsusection should be numbered;
do not remove the numbering from the commands.
Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or
words of a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is **not allowed.**
Below are examples of sectioning commands.

**9.1** **Subsection**

This is a subsection.


**Table 1: Frequency of Special Characters**

Non-English or Math Frequency Comments

Ø 1 in 1,000 For Swedish names

_𝜋_ 1 in 5 Common in math

$ 4 in 5 Used in business
Ψ 1 [2] 1 in 40,000 Unexplained usage

_9.1.1_ _Subsubsection._ This is a subsubsection.

_Paragraph._ This is a paragraph.
Subparagraph This is a subparagraph.

**10** **Tables**

The “ acmart ” document class includes the “ booktabs ” package —
https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs — for preparing high-quality tables.
Table captions are placed _above_ the table.
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement
for them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.
To ensure this proper “floating” placement of tables, use the environment **table** to enclose the table’s contents and the table caption.
The contents of the table itself must go in the **tabular** environment,
to be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules. Again, detailed instructions on **tabular**
material are found in the _L_ _[A]_ _TEX User’s Guide_ .
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which Table 1
is included in the input file; compare the placement of the table
here with the table in the printed output of this document.
To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page’s
live area, use the environment **table*** to enclose the table’s contents
and the table caption. As with a single-column table, this wide
table will “float” to a location deemed more desirable. Immediately
following this sentence is the point at which Table 2 is included in
the input file; again, it is instructive to compare the placement of
the table here with the table in the printed output of this document.
Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows,
and use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies
to recognise table headers and support their users in navigating
tables more easily.

**11** **Math Equations**

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display. Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

**11.1** **Inline (In-text) Equations**

A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula. It is produced by the **math** environment, which
can be invoked with the usual \begin . . . \end construction or
with the short form $ . . . $ . You can use any of the symbols and
structures, from _𝛼_ to _𝜔_, available in L [A] T E X [ **?** ]; this section will
simply show a few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice
how this equation: lim _𝑛_ →∞ _𝑥_ = 0, set here in in-line math style,
looks slightly different when set in display style. (See next section).

Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Trovato et al.

**Table 2: Some Typical Commands**

Command A Number Comments

\author 100 Author

\table 300 For tables

\table* 400 For wider tables

**11.2** **Display Equations**

A numbered display equation—one set off by vertical space from
the text and centered horizontally—is produced by the **equation**
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
**displaymath** environment.
Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in L [A] T E X; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context. First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:

lim (1)
_𝑛_ →∞ _[𝑥]_ [=][ 0]

Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in the **display-**
**math** environment. Now, we’ll enter an unnumbered equation:

∞

_𝑥_ + 1

∑︁

_𝑖_ =0

and follow it with another numbered equation:


∑︁ ∞


_𝑓_ (2)
0


∞ _𝜋_ +2

_𝑥_ _𝑖_ =

∑︁ _𝑖_ =0 ∫ 0


just to demonstrate L [A] TEX’s able handling of numbering.

**12** **Figures**

The “ figure ” environment should be used for figures. One or more
images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains thirdparty material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown in the
example below.
Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure
to the reader.
Figure captions are placed _below_ the figure.
Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is
purely decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image
to someone who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine
crawlers for indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.
A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than
2000 characters long (including spaces). **Figure descriptions should**
**not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture**
**important information that is not already provided in the**
**caption or the main text of the paper.** For figures that convey important and complex new information, a short text description may not be adequate. More complex alternative descriptions
can be placed in an appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example, provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a structured list representing a graph.
For additional information regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is so important, please see https:
//www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/.

**(https://goo.gl/VLCRBB).**

**12.1** **The “Teaser Figure”**

A “teaser figure” is an image, or set of images in one figure, that are
placed after all author and affiliation information, and before the
body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\maketitle command:

\begin{teaserfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
\caption{figure caption}
\Description{figure description}
\end{teaserfigure}

**13** **Citations and Bibliographies**

The use of BibT E X for the preparation and formatting of one’s
references is strongly recommended. Authors’ names should be
complete — use full first names (“Donald E. Knuth”) not initials
(“D. E. Knuth”) — and the salient identifying features of a reference
should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages, article DOI,

etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these
two commands, placed just before the \end{document} command:

\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{bibfile}
where “ bibfile ” is the name, without the “ .bib ” suffix, of the
BibTEX file.

Debuging agent Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY


Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of ACM publications have citations and references formatted in
the “author year” style; for these exceptions, please include this command in the **preamble** (before the command “ \begin{document} ”)
of your L [A] TEX source:

\citestyle{acmauthoryear}

Some examples. A paginated journal article [ **?** ], an enumerated
journal article [ **?** ], a reference to an entire issue [ **?** ], a monograph
(whole book) [ **?** ], a monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a
in spec. document) [ **?** ], a divisible-book such as an anthology or
compilation [ **?** ] followed by the same example, however we only
output the series if the volume number is given [ **?** ] (so Editor00a’s
series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.), a chapter
in a divisible book [ **?** ], a chapter in a divisible book in a series

[ **?** ], a multi-volume work as book [ **?** ], a couple of articles in a
proceedings (of a conference, symposium, workshop for example)

citations: [ **? ? ?** ]. Artifacts: [ **?** ] and [ **?** ].

**14** **Acknowledgments**

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks
to individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:

\begin{acks}

...

\end{acks}

so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.
Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered \section; please use the “acks” environment.

**15** **Appendices**

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the “ \end{document} ”
command at the conclusion of your source document.
Start the appendix with the “appendix” command:

\appendix

and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not numbered.
This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section and
subsection identification method.


**16** **Multi-language papers**

Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as
a rule, a paper in a language other than English should include
an English title and an English abstract). Use language=... for
every language used in the paper. The last language indicated is
the main language of the paper. For example, a French paper with
additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start
with the following command

\documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
language=french]{acmart}

The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the
main language of the paper. The commands \translatedXXX, XXX
begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
in the other languages. The environment translatedabstract
is used to set the translation of the abstract. These commands
and environment have a mandatory first argument: the language
of the second argument. See sample-sigconf-i13n.tex file for
examples of their usage.

**17** **SIGCHI Extended Abstracts**

The “ sigchi-a ” template style (available only in L [A] T E X and not in
Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with a
wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with
the “ sigchi-a ” template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:

**sidebar:** Place formatted text in the margin.
**marginfigure:** Place a figure in the margin.
**margintable:** Place a table in the margin.
