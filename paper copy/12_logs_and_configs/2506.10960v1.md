**Abstract**

Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in
identifying policy violations and improving
the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for
harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We
present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm de
tection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from realworld data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition,
we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline
that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large
language models, enabling smaller models to
achieve performance comparable to state-ofthe-art LLMs [1] .

**1** **Introduction**

Harmful content detection plays a critical role in
maintaining a civilized social media platform (Jiawen et al., 2022; Jahan and Oussalah, 2023; Xiao
et al., 2024a). The unchecked circulation of harmful or illicit content can lead to severe societal,
psychological, and legal consequences (Thomas
et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2024). With the massive
scale of online data rendering manual detection infeasible, recent research has increasingly focused
on leveraging LLMs for automated harmful content
detection (Thomas et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2024;
He et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Kang and

Qian, 2024). Nevertheless, the majority of existing benchmarks and datasets for harmful content
detection are focused on English, with Chinese resources remaining scarce and limited in scope (Xu
et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025).
Even when Chinese datasets are available, they typically focus on a single violation category, most
commonly hate speech, and thus fail to capture the
full spectrum of content safety challenges encountered on Chinese platforms (Jiawen et al., 2022; Lu
et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2024c; Bai et al., 2025;
Yang et al., 2025).
Harmful content detection presents unique challenges that extend beyond those addressed by traditional NLP tasks (Tobi, 2024). In particular, the
Chinese language is highly complex and exhibits
unique linguistic characteristics (Xu et al., 2023;
Fang et al., 2025), further complicating harmful
content detection in Chinese online environments.

There exist a wide variety of perturbation methods in Chinese for evading detection, such as the
use of homophones, homographs, and other similar strategies (Su et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2024c).
For example, as illustrated in Figure 1 under the
Abuse category, users may replace the keyword
“ `母亲` ” (mother) with the homophonic word “ `木`
`琴` ” (piano) to circumvent detection.
To address these gaps, we present

**ChineseHarm-Bench**, a comprehensive multicategory benchmark designed for Chinese harmful
content detection. ChineseHarm-Bench is con
structed from real-world violation records and

covers six representative categories: gambling,
pornography, abuse, fraud, illicit advertisements,
and non-violation. **Notably, every text and**
**label in our benchmark has been validated by**
**professional annotators, guaranteeing high**
**quality and reliability.** Moreover, our annotation
process yields a knowledge rule base that can be
used as an external knowledge source to guide
human annotators and support LLMs in automated
harmful content detection.

LLMs rely on pretraining data, which remains
static once training is complete, limiting their
ability to adapt to new or evolving information (Bigoulaeva et al., 2025). Since pretraining
data is typically clean and curated, it may lack
comprehensive coverage of harmful content, which
evolves dynamically and often exhibits adversarial patterns. To address these limitations and improve resource efficiency (Bai et al., 2024; Wang
et al., 2025), we introduce a knowledge-augmented
baseline (Zhu et al., 2025) that enhances the performance of smaller LLMs for Chinese harmful

content detection. Incorporating external knowledge, such as human-annotated rule bases, provides
up-to-date priors that help both annotators and models recognize subtle violations. By constructing
diverse synthetic detection scenarios through structured prompt design (Markov et al., 2022; Yu et al.,
2023; Chen et al., 2022) and leveraging both explicit rules and teacher-generated responses during
training, our approach enables smaller LLMs to
achieve performance comparable to state-of-theart large models while maintaining efficiency and
accessibility.
Our main contributions are as follows:

  - We present a multi-category, professionally
annotated benchmark for Chinese harmful

content detection, which can be used to evaluate the detection capabilities of LLMs in handling harmful content in Chinese contexts.

  - We manually construct a content safety knowledge rule base during the annotation process,
which not only facilitates future annotation
efforts but also serves as external knowledge
to enhance model detection capabilities.

  - We propose a knowledge-augmented baseline,


and extensive experiments demonstrate that
incorporating external knowledge allows relatively small models to achieve detection performance on par with state-of-the-art LLMs.

**Content Harm Detection.** Automated content

safety detection plays a crucial role in enhancing
community security (Waseem et al., 2017; Schmidt
and Wiegand, 2017; Xiao et al., 2024b). Initially,
methods such as keyword-based detection and topic
analysis were employed to identify unsafe content (Warner and Hirschberg, 2012; MacAvaney
et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2022). Subsequently,
smaller models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019a)
have been employed to train datasets specifically
for the task of harmful content detection (Wulczyn
et al., 2016; Zampieri et al., 2019; Jiawen et al.,
2022; Markov et al., 2022). Owing to the exceptional capabilities of LLMs, there has been a rise
in approaches that directly utilize these models
for harmful content detection (Guo et al., 2023;
He et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Zhang et al.,
2024b). Moreover, a series of guard models have
recently emerged, specifically designed for harmful
content detection (Inan et al., 2023; Team, 2024a;
Llama Team, 2024; Ma et al., 2024; Zeng et al.,
2024; Zhang et al., 2024d; Wen et al., 2025). However, these models primarily focus on English content and are concerned with the output safety of
large models, which differs from the content safety
definitions specific to the Chinese internet.

**Chinese Resources.** Over the years, several
datasets have been proposed to address specific
aspects of harmful content detection in the Chinese
language. COLA (Tang and Shen, 2020) provides
the first Chinese offensive language classification
dataset, while SWSR (Jiang et al., 2022) introduces
the first Chinese dataset specifically targeting sexist content. COLD (Jiawen et al., 2022) provides
a nuanced taxonomy of Chinese offensive content,
while TOXICN (Lu et al., 2023) expands toxicity
detection to both explicit and implicit cases. Building on this, ToxiCloakCN (Xiao et al., 2024c) introduces perturbed examples to evaluate model robustness. Furthermore, Bai et al. (2025) present a spanlevel toxicity extraction dataset, and SCCD (Yang
et al., 2025) offers fine-grained comment-level
annotations for Chinese cyberbullying detection.
Despite these advancements, the focus of these
datasets predominantly remains on hate speech,


2

whereas the scope of Chinese content detection extends beyond this singular aspect. Recent datasets
such as SafetyBench (Zhang et al., 2024c) and
ChineseSafe (Zhang et al., 2025) have attempted
to address broader categories of harmful content.
However, some categories in these datasets, while
related to other aspects of safety, are not directly
relevant to harmful content detection, as certain
types of content are considered acceptable and can
be freely circulated on Chinese platforms.

**3** **Benchmark**

Figure 2 illustrates the overall construction process
of our benchmark. We collect and filter real-world
data, perform clustering-based sampling, and conduct expert annotation with iterative knowledge
rule base refinement. This pipeline ensures a balanced, high-quality dataset with explicit knowledge
rules for each category.

**3.1** **Benchmark Category**

Based on Chinese laws and regulations [23], we select
six representative categories for our study: Gambling, Pornography, Abuse, Fraud, Illicit Ads, and
Non-violation. These categories cover a broad
range of application scenarios and demonstrate
strong representativeness and research value. Figure 1 provides a simple example and its translation
for each category. The basic definitions of these six
categories are as follows:

  - **Gambling:** Content related to gambling activities, including promotion of betting platforms, sharing gambling experiences, or encouraging participation. _Gambling is strictly_
_prohibited by Chinese law due to risks of fi-_
_nancial loss, addiction, family disruption, and_
_social instability._

  - **Pornography:** Content containing vulgar or
obscene material related to sexual acts, such
as explicit descriptions, images, or videos.
_Dissemination of pornographic content is ille-_
_gal in China, as it undermines social morals,_
_harms minors, and disrupts public order._

  - **Abuse:** Content involving abusive language,
insults, or provocation, including personal attacks, hate speech, or harassment. _Such con-_
_tent is prohibited by Chinese regulations as it_

_can cause psychological harm, disrupt social_
_harmony, and incite violence or discrimina-_

_tion._

  - **Fraud:** Content involving deceptive practices
intended to mislead or defraud, such as phishing, scam advertisements, or impersonation.
_Fraud is a criminal offense under Chinese law,_
_posing risks to property and information secu-_
_rity, and undermining social trust._

  - **Illicit Ads:** Content advertising illegal activities or products, including unlicensed drugs,
counterfeit goods, or prohibited services. _Pub-_
_lishing illicit advertisements is strictly for-_
_bidden, as it facilitates criminal activity, en-_
_dangers public safety, and violates consumer_
_rights._

  - **Non-violation:** Content that complies with
Chinese laws and regulations and does not
fall into the above categories. _Such content is_
_considered legal and appropriate for dissemi-_

_nation in China._

**3.2** **Data Collection**

**Data Source.** Our violation data is sourced from

one of the largest social platforms in China. We
collected real-world violation records from the

internal database of an online platform over recent years, covering the five categories described
above. [4] Each data instance is represented as a tuple
_x_ = (text _,_ label), where text denotes the message
content and label _∈C_ is the corresponding category label. The original records are annotated
with a single label upon collection, and each violation category contains approximately 15 _,_ 000
samples. Non-violation data is sourced from the
Alpaca-Chinese (Taori et al., 2023; Ziang Leng and
Li, 2023) dataset, which provides approximately
52 _,_ 000 diverse and legally compliant responses.

**Preliminary Processing.** Due to the proprietary
nature of the platform’s internal annotation guidelines, some labels may be inaccurate and not all annotations have undergone thorough manual review.
Given the impracticality of fully manual annotation, we designed a data filtering and optimization
pipeline to ensure data quality and diversity. Specifically, we first deduplicate the data within each category. Then, for each category _c ∈C_, we apply

the platform’s name.

clustering-based sampling, and expert annotation with iterative knowledge rule base refinement. Finally, 1,000
instances are sampled for each category to form the final benchmark.


k-means clustering with 100 clusters on sentence
embeddings generated by bert-base-chinese .
From each cluster, we randomly sampled 20 instances, resulting in a benchmark set of 2 _,_ 000 samples per category.

**3.3** **Human Annotation**

**Annotator Background.** To ensure annotation
quality, we recruited three professional annotators
from a specialized annotation team. All annotators
are native Chinese speakers (two males and one
female), with two holding bachelor’s degrees and
one holding an associate degree. Each annotator
has substantial prior experience in data annotation
and harmful content detection, ensuring familiarity
with relevant legal and ethical considerations. Before the annotation process, all annotators received
additional training on the specific task requirements
and labeling criteria to further standardize the annotation process.

**Annotation Process.** Let _D_ _c_ = _{x_ _i,c_ _}_ _[N]_ _i_ =1 [denote]
the set of _N_ = 2 _,_ 000 candidate samples for category _c_ . We initialized the knowledge rule base
_R_ _c_ = _∅_ for each category. The annotation process
proceeds as follows for each sample _x_ _i,c_ :

  - If _x_ _i,c_ matches any rule _r ∈R_ _c_, we retain _x_ _i,c_
in _D_ _c_ .

  - If _x_ _i,c_ truly belongs to category _c_ and does not
match any rule in _R_ _c_, we update an existing
rule or add a new rule _r_ _i,c_ to _R_ _c_, and retain
_x_ _i,c_ in _D_ _c_ .



  - If _x_ _i,c_ does not belong to category _c_, we discard _x_ _i,c_ from _D_ _c_ .

After this process, we randomly sampled _M_ =
1 _,_ 000 instances from the retained set for each category to ensure class balance. This procedure guarantees that our final dataset is both diverse and
balanced, with all samples annotated by human
experts. Furthermore, we iteratively refined the
standardized annotation guideline knowledge rule
base _R_ = [�] _c∈C_ _[R]_ _[c]_ [ (see Appendix Table][ 7][).]

**3.4** **Evaluation Metrics**

Our benchmark is designed to evaluate the Chinese
harmful content detection capabilities of LLMs.
Specifically, we adopt a zero-shot setting, where
the model is prompted to classify each input instance into one of the predefined categories using
a standardized template (see Appendix Figure 5).
Given a content item to be detected, we construct
the model input as:

_X_ = Prompt_Detect( _R,_ content) (1)

where _R_ denotes the human-annotated knowledge
rule and content represents the content item to be
detected. Here, Prompt_Detect( _·_ ) refers to the
process of formatting the input according to the
prompt template, incorporating both the rule base
and the content item. The model subsequently predicts the category for each input instance. For evaluation, we report both the per-category F1 scores
and the macro-F1 score. As the dataset is balanced

across categories, the macro-F1 is equivalent to the
weighted-F1.

**4** **A Knowledge-Augmented Baseline**

**4.1** **Hybrid Knowledgeable Prompting**

To comprehensively simulate real-world harmful
content detection scenarios, we first define a set
of hierarchical, fine-grained attributes that characterize different types of illicit content. We formalize the prompt construction process as a mapping
from a structured user-content space to a prompt
space. Specifically, we decompose the scenario
space into four primary components: persona features, text features, evasion tactics, and humanannotated knowledge rules. Notably, our attribute
definitions **incorporate both evasion tactics and**
**external knowledge**, with the aim of more closely
modeling the complexities observed in real-world
illicit content. Each component is further specified
by a set of secondary, fine-grained attributes. For
each violation category _c_, we define the structured
input as

_U_ _c_ = _{U_ persona _, U_ text _, U_ evasion _, U_ knowledge _,c_ _}_ (2)

where:

  - _U_ persona : Information about the author, such as
gender, age, occupation, education, reflecting
diverse writing styles.

  - _U_ text : Intrinsic properties of the text, including
text length, narrative perspective, and publishing platform.

  - _U_ evasion : Evasion strategies commonly observed in real-world scenarios, such as the use
of emojis, homophones, and other techniques
to circumvent detection. See Appendix B for
more detailed explanations.

  - _U_ knowledge _,c_ : The reference to the humanannotated knowledge rule base _R_ _c_ for category _c_, specifying the particular guidelines
violated by the text.

**4.2** **Synthetic Data Curation**

We construct synthetic data by first designing
a comprehensive prompt template, denoted as
prompt_generate (see Appendix Table 9), which
encodes the diverse attributes described above. For

each category _c ∈C_, we define each instance by
its attribute set _U_ _i,c_ _∈_ _U_ _c_ . For each _U_ _i,c_, the input
prompt is constructed as

_Q_ _i,c_ = Prompt_Generate( _U_ _i,c_ ) (3)


Figure 3: Overview of the synthetic data curation
pipeline. We first define a set of hierarchical, finegrained attributes to comprehensively characterize illicit
content. For each category, structured prompts are constructed based on sampled user and content attributes,
evasion tactics, and human-annotated knowledge rules.

Here, Prompt_Generate( _·_ ) refers to the function
that formats the sampled attribute set _U_ _i,c_, together
with the corresponding rule base, into a prompt
suitable for input to the teacher model. A teacher
model _M_ _T_ is then used to generate a candidate
response for each prompt _Q_ _i,c_ :

_A_ _i,c_ = _M_ _T_ ( _Q_ _i,c_ ) (4)

For each category _c ∈C_, we collect a set of
( _Q_ _i,c_ _, A_ _i,c_ ) pairs. To ensure data quality and class
balance, we remove duplicate instances and filter
out model refusals or generic non-answers using a
keyword-matching strategy (see Appendix 8). Finally, we uniformly sample _n_ instances from each
category to construct the final dataset:

_D_ final = � Sample _n_ ( _Q_ _i,c_ _, A_ _i,c_ ) (5)

_c∈C_

This pipeline ensures that the resulting synthetic
dataset is diverse, high-quality, and balanced across
all categories. An overview of the synthetic data
curation pipeline is shown in Figure3.

**4.3** **Knowledge-Guided Training**

To fully leverage both explicit human knowledge
and implicit model knowledge, we adopt a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework that incorporates two distinct sources of knowledge for each
training instance. Specifically, for each sample in
the curated dataset _D_ final, we construct the input by
combining (1) human-annotated knowledge _R_ and
(2) teacher model knowledge, represented by the
answer _A_ _i,c_ generated by the teacher model, which


5

reflects its implicit knowledge. Formally, for each
entry ( _Q_ _i,c_ _, A_ _i,c_ ) in _D_ final, the input to the student
model is constructed as:

_X_ _i,c_ = Prompt_Detect( _R, A_ _i,c_ ) (6)

The student model _M_ _S_ is trained to generate the
target output sequence _c_ . For each instance, the
sequence-level loss is defined as:


_L_ ( _c | X_ _i,c_ _, ϕ_ ) = _−_


_T_ _c_
� log _P_ ( _c_ _t_ _| X_ _i,c_ _, c_ _<t_ ; _ϕ_ )

_t_ =1


(7)
where _c_ = ( _c_ 1 _, c_ 2 _, . . ., c_ _T_ _c_ ) is the tokenized category name for category _c_, and _T_ _c_ is its length. The
fine-tuning objective is to minimize the average
loss over all instances:


**Knowledge Augmentation.** To assess the impact
of external knowledge, we conduct experiments
under two conditions: with ( � ) and without ( � )
knowledge augmentation. For models evaluated
via direct prompting, the knowledge-augmented
setting indicates whether the human-annotated rule
base _R_ and guidelines are included as part of the
input during inference. For models trained via finetuning, _R_ is consistently included in the prompts
during both training and inference of the student
model _M_ _S_ . The knowledge augmentation setting
is further determined by whether such knowledge
is incorporated during the data generation phase of
the teacher model _M_ _T_ .

**Training and Evaluation Details.** For our proposed baseline, we use GPT-4o as the teacher
model _M_ _T_ to generate synthetic data, with a temperature of 1.0 and top- _k_ sampling ( _k_ = 1 ) to
encourage output diversity. We sample _n_ = 3000
synthetic instances per category. Qwen series student models are fine-tuned using the LLaMA Factory (Zheng et al., 2024) framework. All experiments are conducted on 8 Huawei Ascend 910B

NPUs (80GB each). More experimental details are
provided in Appendix C.

**5.2** **Main Results**

**Current LLMs are not yet sufficient to match**

**human annotators.** Recent LLMs have demon
strated impressive capabilities across various domains. However, as shown in Table 1, even the bestperforming models, such as Deepseek-R1 and GPT4o, achieve average macro-F1 scores of no more
than 0.8 when external knowledge is incorporated,
with performance dropping further in the absence
of such knowledge. Additionally, deploying these
models comes at the cost of significant computational resources. Smaller models, while more computationally efficient, perform even worse when
used without fine-tuning, with macro-F1 scores
falling below 0.5 even when external knowledge
is introduced. Importantly, harmful content detection is not a static problem but a dynamic and
adversarial process, where users continuously devise novel evasion strategies to bypass detection
systems. These findings indicate that the task of
Chinese harmful content detection remains a significant challenge for current LLMs and is still far
from achieving performance comparable to that of
human annotators (Phan et al., 2025).

thereby enhancing its detection capability.

**5** **Experiments**

**5.1** **Experimental Setup**

**Model Groups.** To provide a comprehensive
evaluation of Chinese harmful content detection

capabilities, we consider three groups of models: (1) state-of-the-art LLMs, such as DeepseekR1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), GPT series (OpenAI et al., 2024a,b), Gemini series (Team et al.,
2024), and Claude series (Anthropic, 2024); (2)
lightweight models with fewer than 1B parameters,
including Bert-Base-Chinese (Devlin et al., 2019b)
and the smallest Qwen-2.5 model (Team, 2024b;
Yang et al., 2024); and (3) billion-scale LLMs with
1–10B parameters, represented by a range of Qwen2.5 models. This selection covers a wide spectrum
of model sizes and architectures for Chinese harm
ful content detection.

**Evaluation Protocol.** For models evaluated via

direct prompting, we use the original, unmodified
model checkpoints. For models evaluated via finetuning, we refer to student models trained on synthetic data generated by the teacher model.

Table 1: Macro-F1 scores of various models on the ChineseHarm-Bench across six violation categories. We report
results for state-of-the-art LLMs, lightweight models (<1B parameters), and billion-scale LLMs (1–10B parameters)
under both direct prompting and fine-tuning strategies, with ( � ) and without ( � ) knowledge augmentation.
Gray-highlighted columns indicate our proposed strong baseline models with knowledge augmentation.


**Incorporating external knowledge consistently**
**improves model performance.** As shown in Table 1, for all models with more than 1B parameters, providing human-annotated knowledge as
input during direct prompting consistently yields
performance improvements. The only exception is
the Qwen-2.5-0.5B model, which does not benefit
from external knowledge, possibly because models
of this scale lack the capacity to effectively leverage complex knowledge sources. Moreover, in the
fine-tuning scenario, omitting knowledge guidance
during data generation leads to a significant drop in
performance across all model scales. These results
demonstrate that effectively incorporating external
knowledge is essential to achieve optimal performance in harmful content detection tasks.

**Our knowledge-augmented approach substan-**
**tially improves the performance of lightweight**


**and billion-scale models.** As shown in Table 1,
all fine-tuned models with knowledge augmentation achieve macro-F1 scores above 0.7, compared
to original scores below 0.5. Notably, the Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen-2.5-7B models reach a macroF1 of 0.77, surpassing all state-of-the-art LLMs
under direct prompting without external knowledge. This performance is also comparable to GPT4o (0.78) and Deepseek-R1 (0.80) when provided
with external knowledge. Furthermore, even with
knowledge augmentation, models such as GPT-4omini, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and

O3-mini do not exceed a macro-F1 of 0.77. These

results demonstrate that our approach substantially
enhances the harmful content detection capabilities
of lightweight and billion-scale models, enabling
them to achieve performance comparable to the
State-of-the-Art LLMs.

without evasion cases. **Right** : Macro-F1 scores in harmful content detection, showing the relationship with the
number of synthetic samples per category (x-axis in thousands).


**Lightweight models (<1B parameters) face**
**inherent performance ceilings.** While knowledge augmentation improves performance across
all models, the lightweight models Qwen-2.50.5B and BERT-Base-Chinese plateau at macro-F1
scores around 0.70. In contrast, all billion-scale
LLMs closely match the performance of GPT-4o
when external knowledge is incorporated. These
findings highlight the intrinsic limitations of sub1B models, which remain unable to match the effectiveness of larger models on complex Chinese
harmful content detection tasks, even when provided with additional knowledge.

**5.3** **Analysis**

**Effectiveness of generating evasion cases for Chi-**
**nese harmful content detection.** To assess the

impact of evasion cases in synthetic data, we compare models trained on data with and without evasion examples. Specifically, we used GPT-4o to
generate 3k non-evasive samples per category as
the baseline, keeping all other configurations unchanged. As shown in Figure 4 (left), models
trained with evasion cases achieve performance
gains, underscoring the importance of incorporating Chinese-specific evasion data for detection.

**3,000 synthetic samples per category are suffi-**
**cient for optimal performance.** To investigate
the impact of synthetic data volume, we conduct
experiments with 1k, 2k, 3k, and 4k samples per
category. As shown in Figure 4 (right), the performance of most models generally improves as the
number of synthetic samples increases, but plateaus
at 3k samples per category. This suggests that using
more than 3k synthetic samples per category yields
diminishing returns for harmful content detection.


**Using different teacher models for data gener-**
**ation remains effective.** We further investigate
the impact of teacher model selection by using the
Deeseek-R1 model for synthetic data generation,
while keeping the number of samples per category
at 3k and maintaining the same training setup and
configurations. As shown in Table 2, our proposed
baseline continues to achieve strong performance,
demonstrating robustness to the choice of teacher
model and highlighting the broad applicability of
our approach.

**6** **Conclusion**

In this work, we introduce a comprehensive realworld benchmark for Chinese harmful content

detection, encompassing multiple violation categories and accompanied by a professionally curated knowledge rule base. We further propose
a knowledge-augmented strong baseline that integrates explicit knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large teacher models. This approach
enables small models to match or even outperform
much larger models, without sacrificing efficiency
or accessibility. Together, these contributions support practical applications and pave the way for
future research on LLMs for the detection of Chi
nese harmful content.

**Limitations**

Although our benchmark expands the scope of prior
work by covering six distinct violation categories
and provides a more comprehensive taxonomy than
existing datasets, the real-world landscape of content harm detection is far more diverse, and our
current categories may not encompass all possible
violation types. Furthermore, although all annotations in our dataset were performed by professional
annotators, some errors may still be unavoidable
due to the inherent subjectivity and complexity of
harmful content detection. In addition, while our
knowledge rule base provides valuable external
guidance, it cannot fully cover the diverse scenarios and violation types present in real-world data.
This benchmark is for academic use only.

**Ethics Statement**

We obtain all data with proper authorization
from the respective data-owning organizations and
signed the necessary agreements. **The benchmark**
**is released under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license. All**

**datasets have been anonymized and reviewed**
**by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the**
**data provider to ensure privacy protection.**
Moreover, we categorically denounce any malicious misuse of this benchmark and are committed

to ensuring that its development and use consistently align with human ethical principles.

`规则` : { `规则知识` }
`文本` : { `检测文本` }

Figure 5: The **Prompt_Detect** template for zero-shot
Chinese harmful content detection. The model is in
structed to classify the input text into one of five violation categories or “non-violation” according to Chinese
laws and content safety standards. The `规则知识` (“rule
base”) section incorporates the human-annotated knowledge rule base _R_ constructed during our annotation
process, while the `检测文本` (“input text”) section provides the text instance to be classified.

**B** **Evasion Patterns and Case Studies**

On the Chinese internet, users often employ various
evasion strategies to circumvent harmful content
detection. To simulate these real-world behaviors,
we instruct the teacher model to adopt a keyword
substitution strategy, systematically replacing sensitive terms with pinyin (phonetic transcription),
homophones (words with similar pronunciation),
homographs (visually similar), or emojis. Representative examples of these four evasion strategies
are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Representative examples of four common
evasion strategies: pinyin, homophones, homographs,
and emoji.

**C** **Additional Experimental Details**

For all state-of-the-art LLMs, all models except DeepSeek-R1 are accessed via APIs, while


DeepSeek-R1 is deployed locally. To ensure reproducibility, we set the temperature to 0 for all
API-based models. For all Qwen series models,
inference is performed using greedy decoding.
For fine-tuning the Qwen series student models,
we utilize the LLaMA Factory (Zheng et al., 2024)
framework with the following hyperparameters: a
per-device batch size of 4, gradient accumulation
steps of 2, a learning rate of 1 _._ 0 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [5], three
epochs, cosine learning rate scheduling, a warmup
ratio of 0.1, and bfloat16 precision.
For the BERT-based sequence classification
baseline, we employ the HuggingFace Transformers library and fine-tune the model with 6 output
classes. The model is trained for 3 epochs with a
learning rate of 2 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [5], a batch size of 32 for
training and 128 for evaluation, and a weight decay
of 0.01. Mixed-precision (fp16) training is enabled
to accelerate computation and reduce memory usage. All other hyperparameters follow the default
settings of the Transformers library.
