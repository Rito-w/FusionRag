We determine the full statistics of nonstationary heat transfer in the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti
lattice gas model at long times by uncovering and exploiting complete integrability of the underlying
equations of the macroscopic fluctuation theory. These equations are closely related to the derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (DNLS), and we solve them by the Zakharov-Shabat inverse
scattering method (ISM) adapted by Kaup and Newell (1978) for the DNLS. We obtain explicit
results for the exact large deviation function of the transferred heat for an initially localized heat
pulse, where we uncover a nontrivial symmetry relation.


_Introduction._ – Full statistics of currents of matter

or energy in macroscopic systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium is a fundamental quantity that has
attracted much attention from statistical physicists in
the past two decades. Major progress has been achieved
in determining this quantity for nonequilibrium steady
states in simple models of interacting particles [1–4].
Nonstationary fluctuations of current, however, proved
to be much harder for analysis [5–11].
A convenient and widely used family of models for
studying the full statistics of currents is stochastic lattice gases [12–15]. One important example is the KipnisMarchioro-Presutti (KMP) model of heat transfer. The
KMP model involves immobile particles occupying a
whole lattice and carrying continuous amounts of energy. At each random move the total energy of a randomly chosen pair of nearest neighbors is randomly redistributed among them according to uniform distribution.
The KMP model originally attracted much interest as the
first model for which Fourier’s law of heat diffusion at a
coarse-grained level was proven rigorously [16]. By now
it has become a paradigmatic model of nonequilibrium
fluctuations of transport [4, 6–8, 11, 17–27].
Here we study a full non-stationary heat-transfer
statistics in the KMP model on an infinite onedimensional lattice. Suppose that only one particle has a
nonzero energy at _t_ = 0. Due to the energy exchange with
the neighbors, the energy will start spreading throughout
the system. At times much longer than the inverse rate of
the energy exchange between the two neighbors (equal to
1 _/_ 2), and at distances much larger than the lattice constant (equal to 1), the mean coarse-grained temperature
_u_ ¯( _x, t_ ) in the KMP model is governed by the heat diffusion equation [12, 14, 16] _∂_ _t_ _u_ ¯( _x, t_ ) = _∂_ _x_ [2] _[u]_ [¯][(] _[x, t]_ [). The ini-]
tial temperature is a delta-function, ¯ _u_ ( _x, t_ = 0) = _Wδ_ ( _x_ ),
and so the solution is

coarse-grained temperature will fluctuate around the expected profile ¯ _u_ ( _x, t_ ), see Fig. 1. To characterize these
non-stationary fluctuations, we will consider the total
amount of heat _W_ _>_, observed on the right half line _x >_ 0
at time _t_ = _T ≫_ 1. The expected value of _W_ _>_ is _W/_ 2,
and we will study the full time-dependent statistics of

Similar non-stationary large-deviation settings, but
with a _step-like_ initial condition for the particle density
or temperature, have been recently studied for a whole
family of diffusive lattice gases [6–10], of which the KMP
model is an important particular case. The main working
tool of these studies has been the macroscopic fluctuation
theory (MFT) [28]: a weak-noise theory, whose starting
point is fluctuational hydrodynamics (FH) [12, 14, 29].
The FH is a coarse-grained description of the lattice gas,
which is accurate when the characteristic length scale
of the problem (here the diffusion length _√T_ ) and the

observation time _T_ are much larger than the lattice constant 1 and the inverse elemental rate 1 _/_ 2 of the energy
exchange, respectively. For diffusive lattice gases with a


However, in stochastic realizations of the KMP model the

single conservation law the FH has the form of a single
macroscopic Langevin equation, which accounts for the
fluctuational contribution to the heat or mass flux. For
the KMP model the Langevin equation reads [12, 14]


The condition on the heat excess at _t_ = _T_ becomes

The minimization of the action functional, that enters
the constrained path integral, with respect to variations
of _u_ ( _x, t_ ) yields, aside from Eqs. (3) and (4), a second
boundary condition in time [6],

_v_ ( _x, t_ = 1) = _−λ δ_ ( _x_ ) _,_ (7)

where _λ_ plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier, to be
ultimately fixed by the constraint (6).
Once _u_ ( _x, t_ ) and _v_ ( _x, t_ ) are found, one can calculate
the rescaled action, which can be written as [6–8]


where _u_ ( _x, t_ ) is the temperature, and _η_ ( _x, t_ ) is a
delta-correlated Gaussian noise: _⟨η_ ( _x, t_ ) _⟩_ = 0 and
_⟨η_ ( _x, t_ ) _η_ ( _x_ _[′]_ _, t_ _[′]_ ) _⟩_ = _δ_ ( _x −_ _x_ _[′]_ ) _δ_ ( _t −_ _t_ _[′]_ ).
The MFT [28] relies on a saddle-point evaluation of
the path integral for the stochastic process, described by
Eq. (2). The small parameter of the saddle-point evaluation is again 1 _/√T ≪_ 1: long times correspond to a

weak noise. The saddle-point evaluation of the path integral boils down to a minimization of the action functional

[30], constrained by the specified heat excess _J_ at _t_ = _T_
and obeying the specified initial condition _u_ ( _x, t_ = 0).
For the statistics of the heat (or mass) excess, the MFT
equations and boundary conditions in time were derived
in Ref. [6], and we will present them shortly. For completeness, we also present their derivation in [30]. The
solution of the MFT problem describes the _optimal path_
of the process: the most likely time history of the temperature field _u_ ( _x, t_ ) which dominates the probability distribution _P_ ( _J, T_ ) that we are after. The MFT problem,
however, has proven to be very hard to solve analytically, especially for quenched (that is, deterministic) initial conditions [31]. In particular, for the KMP model,
only small- _J_ [7] and large- _J_ [8] asymptotes have been
obtained until now (but for a step-like initial condition).
This Letter reports a major advance in this area of statistical mechanics. We present an exact solution to the
heat excess statistics problem by uncovering and exploiting complete integrability of the underlying MFT equations. We obtain explicit results for an initially localized
heat pulse, _u_ ( _x, t_ = 0) = _Wδ_ ( _x_ ), for which we uncover a
nontrivial time-reversal mirror symmetry. These are the
first exact non-steady-state large-deviation results for the
statistics of current in a lattice gas of interacting particles
for quenched initial conditions.
_Formulation of the MFT problem_ [6, 30]. – Let us
rescale _t_, _x_ and _u_ by _T_, _√T_ and _W/√T_, respectively.

The optimal path we are after is described by two coupled Hamilton’s equations for the rescaled temperature
field _u_ ( _x, t_ ) and the conjugate “momentum density” field
_p_ ( _x, t_ ) which describes the optimal history of the noise
_η_ ( _x, t_ ), conditioned on the heat excess _J_ .
It is convenient to introduce the (minus) gradient field
_v_ ( _x, t_ ) = _−∂_ _x_ _p_ ( _x, t_ ). In the variables _u_ and _v,_ the MFT
equations take the form [6, 8, 30]

_∂_ _t_ _u_ = _∂_ _x_ ( _∂_ _x_ _u_ + 2 _u_ [2] _v_ ) _,_ (3)

_∂_ _t_ _v_ = _∂_ _x_ ( _−∂_ _x_ _v_ + 2 _uv_ [2] ) _._ (4)

The rescaled initial condition is

Since _√T ≫_ 1, Eq. (9) has a clear large-deviation struc
ture, and the action _s_ plays the role of a rate function.
A crucial and previously unappreciated observation is
that Eqs. (3) and (4) coincides with the derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger (DNLS) equation in imaginary time
and space [32]. The DNLS equation (with real time
and space) describes propagation of nonlinear electromagnetic waves in plasmas and other media [33]. An
_initial-value_ problem for the DNLS equation is completely integrable via the Zakharov-Shabat inverse scattering method (ISM) adapted by Kaup and Newell for
the DNLS [33]. The MFT formulation presents an difficulty, however, as here one needs to solve a _boundary-_
_value_ problem in time, rather than an initial-value problem. Here we overcome this difficulty by (i) making use of
a shortcut that allows one to determine the rate function
_s_ ( _j_ ) even without the knowledge of _u_ ( _x, t_ ) and _v_ ( _x, t_ ) for
all _t_, and (ii) exploiting a previously unknown symmetry
relation [34], specific to the initial condition (5):

_v_ ( _x, t_ ) = _−λ u_ ( _−x,_ 1 _−_ _t_ ) _._ (10)

_Solution of the MFT problem._ – Equations (3) and (4)
belong to a class of integrable systems for which a Lax
pair exists, _i.e._, as we explain below, the equations are
equivalent to the compatibility condition of a system of
two linear differential equations. The latter system defines scattering amplitudes which depend on _u_ and _v_ .
The idea behind the approach that we shall use – the
ISM – is to consider the time evolution of these scatter
ing amplitudes, which turns out to be very simple, as
shown below. By relating these scattering amplitudes,

at _t_ = 0 and _t_ = 1, to the fields _u_ and _v_, the method will
enable us to find the heat excess _j_ = _j_ ( _λ_ ) which suffices
for the calculation of _s_ = _s_ ( _j_ ).

Adapting the derivation of Kaup and Newell [33] to

and _k_ is a spectral parameter. As one can check, the compatibility condition _∂_ _t_ _∂_ _x_ _**ψ**_ = _∂_ _x_ _∂_ _t_ _**ψ**_, which corresponds

to

_∂_ _t_ _U −_ _∂_ _x_ _V_ + [ _U, V_ ] = 0 _,_ (13)

is indeed equivalent to Eqs. (3) and (4).
Let us define the matrix _T_ ( _x, y, t, k_ ) as the _x_  propagator of the system (11), namely, the solution to

_∂_ _x_ _T_ ( _x, y, t, k_ ) = _U_ ( _x, t, k_ ) _T_ ( _x, y, t, k_ ) (14)

with _T_ ( _x, x, t, k_ ) = _I_ (the identity matrix). At _x →±∞_,
where the fields _u_ ( _x, t_ ) and _v_ ( _x, t_ ) vanish, the matrix _U_
becomes very simple,

Therefore, it is natural to define the full-space propagator
_G_ ( _t, k_ ) as follows:

where we have introduced here a notation for the matrix

Plugging the temporal boundary conditions (5) and

Eq. (14), see [30]. Comparing the two solutions and using

The entries of the matrix _G_ ( _t, k_ ) are the scattering amplitudes of the system (11). The time evolution of _G_ ( _t, k_ )
is easy to find. Indeed, the matrix _T_ ( _x, y, t, k_ ) satisfies:

_Q_ + (0) is given by Eq. (26), and the integration constant
was determined from _s_ ( _λ_ = 0) = 0. Equations (27) and
(29) give the complete rate function _s_ ( _j_ ) in a parametric
form and represent the main result of this work. The
exact optimal history of the temperature profile _u_ ( _x, t_ )
proved difficult to obtain analytically, but it can be computed numerically [30].
Figure 3 shows _s_ ( _j_ ) alongside with two asymptotes:
_j →_ 0 and _|j| →_ 1 _/_ 2, which correspond to _λ →_ 0 and
_|λ| →∞_, respectively. Also shown are results of MonteCarlo simulations. The asymptote _λ →_ 0 can be obtained


where _∆_ _≡_ 1 _/_ 2 _−|j| ≪_ 1, and _W_ _−_ 1 ( _. . ._ ) is the proper
branch of the product log (Lambert _W_ ) function [37]. At
_j_ = 1 _/_ 2, _s_ diverges and _P_ vanishes, as to be expected.
Nested-log large-current asymptotes similar to Eq. (31)
appear to be typical for the KMP model and other models
of the hyperbolic universality class [8, 9, 11].
_Discussion._ – By combining the MFT and the ISM, we
calculated exactly the rate function _s_ ( _j_ ), see Eqs. (27)
and (29), which describes the full long-time statistics
of nonstationary heat transfer in the KMP model for
an initially localized heat pulse. This is the first exact non-steady-state large-deviation result for the statistics of current in a lattice gas of interacting particles for

quenched initial conditions. It opens the way to extensions of the ISM to additional fluctuating quantities of
the KMP model. Another challenging goal is to apply the
ISM to the simple symmetric exclusion process (SSEP)

[12–15] – a lattice-gas model with quite different properties [9]. Encouragingly, the MFT equations for the SSEP
(see _e.g._ [6]) can be mapped to Eqs. (3) and (4) via a
canonical transformation. This transformation, however,
complicates the boundary conditions in time.
From a more general perspective, the MFT of lattice
gases is a particular case of the weak-noise theory, or
optimal fluctuation method (OFM): a highly versatile
framework which captures a broad class of large deviations in macroscopic systems. For non-stationary processes the OFM equations – coupled nonlinear partial
differential equations for the optimal path – are usually very hard to solve exactly. One class of problems
of this type, which has received much recent attention,
deals with the complete one-point height statistics of an
interface whose dynamics is described by the KardarParisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [38]. The OFM captures
the complete KPZ height statistics at short times [39–44].
Here too, a previous analytical progress in the solution
of the OFM equations was limited to asymptotics of very
large or very small interface height. But very recently
these OFM equations – which coincide with the Nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLS) (not the derivative one)

[42] – have been solved exactly [45, 46] by the ISM for
several “standard” initial conditions. The two integrable
systems, the NLS and DNLS, are closely related, so our
approach can be compared with that of Refs. [45, 46]. We
used only standard techniques of the ISM which do not
rely on additional tools, such as Fredholm determinants
used in Refs. [45, 46]. Because of its relative simplicity
our approach appears to be more readily adaptable to
solving additional large-deviation problems [47].

[31] For an annealed step-like initial condition (a stepfunction with equilibrium density distributions with given
average densities _u_ _−_ and _u_ + at _x <_ 0 and _x >_ 0), the
full heat transfer statistics for the KMP model was found
by Derrida and Gerschenfeld [6]. They achieved it by uncovering an exact mapping between the KMP model and
the simple symmetric exclusion process, where an exact
microscopic solution was previously obtained [5].

Here we give some technical details of the calculations described in the main text of the Letter.

**I.** **DERIVATION OF THE MFT EQUATIONS AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS**

We begin by defining an auxiliary potential

_x_
_ψ_ ( _x, t_ ) = _u_ ( _y, t_ ) _dy ._ (S1)
� _−∞_

Integrating Eq. (2) of the main text with respect to _x_ and using the boundary condition _u_ ( _x →−∞, t_ ) _→_ 0, we obtain
a Langevin equation for _ψ_ ( _x, t_ ):


_∂_ _t_ _ψ_ = _∂_ _x_ [2] _[ψ]_ [ +] _√_ 2 _∂_ _x_ _ψ η ._ (S2)


Now we use a path-integral approach, by writing the probability density functional _P_ [ _η_ ] of the white Gaussian noise
term _η_ ( _x, t_ ):

We now express _η_ through _ψ_ via Eq. (S2), enabling us to write the probability density for a given history of the
system:

where _S_ [ _ψ_ ] is the action functional. The presence of the large parameter _√T ≫_ 1 enables us to calculate _P_ ( _J, T_ )

via a saddle-point evaluation of the path integral. Within this framework, _−_ ln _P_ ( _J, T_ ) is given by minimum of the
action functional _S_, constrained on the initial condition _u_ ( _x,_ 0) = _Wδ_ ( _x_ ) and on a given value of heat excess _J_ . The
_∞_
heat excess, which we recall is _J_ = � 0 _u_ ( _x, t_ = _T_ ) _dx −_ _W/_ 2, is conveniently rewritten as _J_ = _W/_ 2 _−_ _ψ_ (0 _, T_ ) (where
we used the conservation law � _−∞∞_ _[u]_ [(] _[x, t]_ [ =] _[ T]_ [)] _[ dx]_ [ =] _[ W]_ [). To take into account the latter constraint on] _[ J]_ [, we add the]
term _−Λψ_ (0 _, T_ ) to the action, where _Λ_ is a Lagrange multiplier, i.e., we minimize the constrained functional

The subsequent procedure is pretty standard. Consider a variation _ψ_ ( _x, t_ ) _→_ _ψ_ ( _x, t_ ) + _δψ_ ( _x, t_ ). This leads to a
variation of _S_ _Λ_ [ _ψ_ ], which, to first order in _δψ_ is given by

� _−∞_


where the first two terms in the single integral are the boundary terms originating from the integration by parts in
time. For the quenched (deterministic) initial condition, the variation _δψ_ ( _x,_ 0) vanishes.
The second MFT equation, Eq. (4) in the main text is now obtained by requiring the double integral in (S8) to
vanish for arbitrary _δψ_ (recalling that _v_ = _−∂_ _x_ _p_ and _u_ = _∂_ _x_ _ψ_ ). The first MFT equation, Eq. (3) in the main text,
follows from Eq. (S7) after multiplying by the denominator and then taking a spatial derivative. Note that, under the
rescalings of _x_, _t_ and _u_ described in the text, _v_ should be rescaled by 1 _/W_ . These rescalings leave the MFT equations
invariant. Requiring the single integral in Eq. (S8) to vanish for arbitrary _δψ_ ( _x, T_ ), we obtain the boundary condition

_∂_ _x_ _p_ ( _x, T_ ) = _−Λδ_ ( _x_ ) _._ (S9)

After the rescaling, this becomes Eq. (7) in the main text, where _λ_ = _WΛ_ is a rescaled Lagrange multiplier. Finally,
_T_ _∞_
using Eq. (S7) in (S4) we find that the action can be rewritten as _S_ = � 0 _[dt]_ � _−∞_ _[dx u]_ [2] _[v]_ [2] [ which, after the rescaling,]
leads to _S_ = _√T s_ where the rescaled action _s_ is given by Eq. (8) in the main text. The large parameter _S ∼_ _√T ≫_ 1

justifies _a posteriori_ the saddle-point approximation that we used.

**II.** **SOLVING THE SCATTERING PROBLEM AT** _t_ = 0 **AND** _t_ = 1

Let us find the matrix _T_ ( _x, y,_ 0 _, k_ ) at _t_ = 0. By solving Eq. (14) of the main text at _t_ = 0, using _u_ ( _x,_ 0) = _δ_ ( _x_ ),
one gets

where _v_ _±_ = _v_ (0 _[±]_ _,_ 0). This turns Eq. (20) of the main text into

(1 + _v_ + ) (1 _−_ _v_ _−_ ) _e_ _[M]_ [+] [(] _[k]_ [)+] _[M]_ _[−]_ [(] _[k]_ [)] = 1 + _iλke_ _[−][k]_ [2] _,_ (S17)

provided the condition


(1 + _v_ + ) (1 _−_ _v_ _−_ ) = 1 (S19)

is satisfied. Eq. (S18) is derived by noting that _Q_ _±_ are analytic in the upper and lower half plane respectively and
are well-behaved when _k_ is allowed to reach infinity through the respective half-planes. We then use the well-known
decomposition _f_ ( _k_ ) = _f_ + ( _k_ ) + _f_ _−_ ( _k_ ) of a general function _f_ ( _k_ ) into functions analytic in the upper and lower half_f_ ( _k_ _[′]_ )
planes, _f_ _±_ ( _k_ ), respectively, given by _f_ _±_ ( _k_ ) = � _k_ _[′]_ _−k∓i_ 0 [+] 2 _[dk]_ _πi_ _[′]_ [. This decomposition is applied to the logarithm of Eq.]

(S17). Plugging Eq. (S18) into Eq. (S16), we obtain the solution given in Eqs. (22) and (23) of the main text.

**IV.** **CALCULATING** _Q_ + (0)

The imaginary part of the integrand is an odd function of _k_ and therefore does not contribute to the integral. Keeping
only the real part and simplifying it, we obtain (26) of the main text, where we replaced the principal value integral
by a regular integral since the integrand is regular at _k_ = 0.

**V.** **ASYMPTOTICS OF SMALL AND LARGE** _λ_

At small _λ_ Eq. (26) of the main text yields

therefore _j_ ( _λ ≪_ 1) _≃_ _λ/_ (4 _√_


therefore _j_ ( _λ ≪_ 1) _≃_ _λ/_ (4 _√_ 2 _π_ ). Now, using the _|z| ≪_ 1 asymptotic Li 2 ( _−z_ ) _≃−z_ in the integrand of Eq. (29)

of the main text, we obtain after a simple algebra: _s_ ( _λ ≪_ 1) _≃_ _λ_ [2] _/_ (8 _√_ 2 _π_ ). This yields the asymptotic behavior

_s_ ( _j ≪_ 1) _≃_ 2 _√_ 2 _π j_ [2] given in the main text.


_s_ ( _j ≪_ 1) _≃_ 2 _√_ 2 _π j_ [2] given in the main text.

Now we consider the _|λ| ≫_ 1 asymptote and start from Eq. (26) of the main text. Due to the symmetry _j_ ( _−λ_ ) =
_−j_ ( _λ_ ), _s_ ( _−λ_ ) = _s_ ( _λ_ ) we consider only _λ >_ 0. Let us denote the integrand in Eq. (26) (including the factor 1 _/_ 4 _π_ ) by


ln 1 + _λ_ [2] _k_ [2] _e_ _[−]_ [2] _[k]_ [2] [�]
�
_F_ ( _λ, k_ ) = _._

4 _πk_ [2]


We can recast it as

where


�1 + _λ_ [2] _k_ [2] [�]
_F_ ( _λ, k_ ) = [ln] + _Φ_ ( _λ, k_ ) _,_ (S22)

4 _πk_ [2]

1+ _λ_ [2] _k_ [2] �


_._ (S23)
4 _πk_ [2]


The integral over the first term of Eq. (S22) yields _λ/_ 2, and we now focus on the integral of _Φ_ ( _λ, k_ ). For _λ ≫_ 1,
_Φ_ ( _λ, k_ ) as a function of _k_ behaves as follows (see Fig. 4). At 1 _≪_ _λk <_ _√_ ln _λ_, _Φ_ ( _λ, k_ ) is approximately constant and

equal to _−_ 1 _/_ (2 _π_ ). This asymptote is obtained when neglecting 1 in the numerator and in the denominator of the
fraction inside the logarithm in Eq. (S23). For _k_ ≳ _√_ ln _λ_, _Φ_ ( _λ, k_ ) behaves as


_Φ_ ( _λ, k_ ) _≃_ [ln] � _λ_ [2] 1 _k_ [2] � _._ (S24)

4 _πk_ [2]


This asymptote is obtained when neglecting the second term in the numerator and 1 in the denominator of the fraction
inside the logarithm in Eq. (S23). Importantly, the transition from the asymptote _−_ 1 _/_ (2 _π_ ) to the asymptote (S24)
occurs in a narrow boundary layer around _k_ = _√_ ln _λ_, whose width goes to zero as _λ →∞_ . Furthermore, the region

of _k_ ≲ 1 _/λ_ contributes a term _O_ (1 _/λ_ ) to the integral which, as we shall see _a posteriori_, is negligible. Therefore, we
can divide the integration region into two subregions: 0 _< k <_ _√_ ln _λ_ and _√_ ln _λ < k < ∞_, and use the asymptote

_Φ_ ( _λ, k_ ) _≃−_ 1 _/_ (2 _π_ ) in the former subregion, and Eq. (S24) in the latter one. Keeping the leading and two subleading
terms in the result and multiplying it by 2 to account for _k <_ 0, we obtain

magenta dashed lines, respectively), for _λ_ = 10 [6] . The region of _k_ ≲ 1 _/λ_ cannot be seen on this scale, and its contribution to
the integral is negligible.

Using the relation (27) of the main text between _j_ and _Q_ + (0), we obtain in the leading order:

To calculate the large- _λ_ asymptote of _s_ ( _λ_ ), we plug (S26) into the first equality in (28) in the main text to get

(Note that, in the limit _λ ≫_ 1 that we consider here, the integration constant is not important.) Solving Eq. (S26)
for _λ_, we obtain

where _∆_ _≡_ 1 _/_ 2 _−_ _j ≪_ 1, and _W_ _−_ 1 ( _. . ._ ) is the proper branch of the product log (Lambert _W_ ) function [1]. Plugging
Eq. (S29) into Eq. (S28), we obtain the large- _j_ asymptote (31) of the main text.

**VI.** **OBTAINING THE OPTIMAL PATH** _u_ ( _x, t_ ) **NUMERICALLY AT ALL TIMES**

Our exact solution gives the rate function _s_ ( _j_ ) but it does not give the optimal path _u_ ( _x, t_ ) at all times. To calculate
the latter analytically, one would need to solve Eq. (14) of the main text at arbitrary times 0 _≤_ _t ≤_ 1, and this is far
more challenging than solving it only at _t_ = 0 and _t_ = 1, as we did. The optimal path can, however, be computed
numerically, using the back-and-forth iteration algorithm due to Chernykh and Stepanov [2]. The results of one such
calculation are shown in Fig. 5.

is a shock-like singularity of _u_ at _x_ = 0 and _t_ = 1.

**VII.** **MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS**

Here we describe how the numerical data in Fig. 3 of the main text was generated. We performed Monte-Carlo
(MC) simulations of the microscopic KMP model. The dynamical object in the simulations is the vector of energies
at 2 _L_ + 1 lattice sites, _u_ _−L_ _, . . ., u_ _−_ 1 _, u_ 0 _, u_ 1 _, . . . u_ _L_, where the site 0 represents the origin, _x_ = 0. Initially, all of the
energy is at the origin, _u_ _i_ = _δ_ _i,_ 0 (this corresponds to _W_ = 1). At every Monte-Carlo step, we randomly choose one
of the 2 _L_ adjacent pairs of lattice sites ( _i, i_ + 1), and randomly redistribute their total energy between them, i.e.,

˜ ˜
_u_ _i_ _, u_ _i_ +1 _→_ _u_ _i_ _,_ ˜ _u_ _i_ +1 where ˜ _u_ _i_ is sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and _u_ _i_ + _u_ _i_ +1, and ˜ _u_ _i_ +1 = _u_ _i_ + _u_ _i_ +1 _−u_ _i_ .
Since (in our convention) the microscopic rate of this elementary process is 2, the total number of steps in the
simulation is randomly sampled from a Poisson distribution with mean 4 _TL_ . The excess heat was measured at _t_ = _T_
as _J_ = _u_ 0 _/_ 2 + [�] _[L]_ _i_ =1 _[u]_ _[i]_ _[ −]_ [1] _[/]_ [2. Since the distribution is exactly symmetric,] _[ P]_ [(] _[J, T]_ [) =] _[ P]_ [(] _[−][J, T]_ [), a histogram of the]
absolute values of the simulated _J_ ’s was constructed. For the data plotted on Fig. 3 of the main text, the parameters
used were _T_ = 100 and _L_ = 25 (we found that increasing _L_ beyond this value did not noticeably affect the results
displayed in the figure). The symbols in the figure correspond to


_−_ ln � _√_


2 _πV P_ ( _J, T_ ) _/√_
�


_T,_ (S30)

where the probability density function _P_ ( _J, T_ ) was computed from the histogram of the simulated _J_ ’s, and _V_ =
1 _/√_ 32 _πT_ is our prediction for the variance [see the paragraph following Eq. (30) of the main text]. The term _√_ 2 _πV_

in Eq. (S30) comes from the normalization of the central part of the distribution, rather than from a systematic
calculation of the pre-exponential factor in _P_ ( _J, T_ ) which is beyond the leading-order MFT. The normalization
approximation of the pre-exponential factor introduces a small systematic error at moderate _J_ which is discernible in
Fig. 3 of the main text. The relative error, introduced by the pre-exponential factor, must go to zero as _√T_ goes to

infinity.
As to be expected, direct MC simulations become prohibitively long for larger _J_ and _T_ . Special methods of large
deviation sampling should be used for these purposes.
