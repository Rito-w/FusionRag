Developing autonomous driving systems (ADSs) involves generating and storing extensive log data from test drives, which is
essential for verification, research, and simulation. However, these
high-frequency logs, recorded over varying durations, pose challenges for developers attempting to locate specific driving scenarios.
This difficulty arises due to the wide range of signals representing
various vehicle components and driving conditions, as well as unfamiliarity of some developers’ with the detailed meaning of these
signals. Traditional SQL-based querying exacerbates this challenge
by demanding both domain expertise and database knowledge,
often yielding results that are difficult to verify for accuracy.
This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported
approach that combines signal log data with video recordings from
test drives, enabling natural language based scenario searches while
reducing the need for specialized knowledge. By leveraging scenario
distance graphs and relative gap indicators, it provides quantifiable
metrics to evaluate the reliability of query results. The method is
implemented as an API for efficient database querying and retrieval
of relevant records, paired with video frames for intuitive visualization. Evaluation on an open industrial dataset demonstrates
improved efficiency and reliability in scenario retrieval, eliminating
dependency on a single data source and conventional SQL.

Autonomous driving software is complex in terms of functionality
and testing. The software must be capable of real-time processing
of several signals from sensors [ 2 ], create a model of the driving situation, and then send signals to the actuators, preserving the safety
of the passengers. Testing this software is even more challenging,
requiring traditional methods like unit and system testing, as well
as real-world and simulation testing for autonomous vehicles [ 13 ].
Thorough testing also involves collecting rare scenario data and
annotating existing data [ 16 ]. Machine learning (ML) patterns, such
as Data Lakes, are already employed to collect data from test vehicles [ 14 ]. Test vehicles are equipped with numerous sensors and
LiDAR systems to test and assess new features in on-road testing. During these tests, sensor metadata is processed by onboard
software, generating actuator signals. This signal data is logged
in files for developers and testers to analyze and optimize vehicle
safety, comfort, and performance. However, different components
record data at varying frequencies, resulting in approximately 100
records per second. This generates a massive volume of data stored
in databases and makes it difficult to locate specific scenarios.
In current software development practice, developers rely on
SQL to query specific scenarios. The challenge arises when they
attempt to craft queries for complex conditions. For instance, a
developer needs to find a scenario such as "driving the vehicle in
the rain at a speed of 45 km per hour". The sheer volume of signal
types, coupled with the complexity of understanding each signal’s
purpose and use, makes it nearly impossible for any developer to
construct effective queries without extensive expertise. Secondly,
signal names are long, sometimes exceeding 150 characters (e.g.,
*****_qm_sensorfusion_a/****_qm_sensorfusion_a_vehicle
_motion_stat e_data/data/lateral_velocity/velocity/meters_per_second/value ). The length and complexity of the signal names translate to the length and complexity of the columns
and tables in the databases where the signal data are stored. It
becomes challenging to recall the exact header for querying, especially when multiple signals are related to the same keyword and
multiple keywords appear in the scenario. Crafting SQL queries
requires engineers to understand not only the signals, but also the
database structure.

Crafting the SQL query is one challenge, and another is the evaluation process. The lack of labels complicates evaluation, as creating
labels is difficult due to the fact that records can be described from
multiple perspectives. As a result, the output can only be assessed
by checking its general alignment with the query, rather than identifying an exact or optimal match. This means that after a query
is executed, the results must be manually evaluated, as there is no

quantitative metric to measure the accuracy or relevance of the
retrieved records.

In this paper, we focus on enhancing the usability of log data in
autonomous driving by allowing software engineers to use natural
language queries to retrieve relevant driving scenarios. We address
the following research questions:

  - **RQ1:** How do different data modalities, models and prompts
affect description generation?

  - **RQ2:** How do query difficulty and the keyword selection
impact the quality and effectiveness of data retrieval?

  - **RQ3:** Which metrics and indicators can be used to assess
the query results?

To address these questions, we are conducting an empirical study
with our industrial partner, Zenseact. To illustrate the results, in
this paper, we use an open dataset for replicability, the Zenseact
Open Dataset (ZOD) [ 3 ], which contains 1,473 publicly accessible
sequences. Lastly, we fully utilize video data to enhance scenario
descriptions, incorporating motion-related details.

**2** **Related Work**

Signal data is generated by processing raw sensor data collected
from various equipment using onboard software. Instead of relying on signal data, many studies have explored the direct use
of sensor data. Chen et al. [ 5 ] labeled LiDAR data from test vehicles for classification tasks, achieving performance comparable
to manually labeled data. Baur et al. [ 4 ] introduced SLIM, a selfsupervised model that distinguishes moving objects from stationary
ones. While these models are effective, they are not suited to our
research as they mainly provide general classification labels from a
single perspective and cannot handle diverse sensor data to generate comprehensive descriptions. Therefore, we used signal data
processed by onboard software instead of raw sensor data.
Since the signal data is stored in tables, we explored state-ofthe-art methods for querying tabular data. One approach involves
training or fine-tuning encoder-based models on labeled table data

[ 11, 21 ], but this requires labeled data, which we lack. Another
option is the decoder-based approach [ 8, 11, 15 ], which enhances
performance by improving prompts and generated descriptions.
However, this method relies on textual information to produce
accurate descriptions, and since our data is entirely numeric, generating meaningful descriptions is challenging.
Understanding the context of video data is a popular task in computer vision. Earlier approaches used LSTM-based models [ 9, 20, 22 ],
focusing on generating captions or summarizing video content.
More recent transformer-based models [ 17, 24, 25 ] have been developed to generate textual descriptions from video. A growing trend
is the use of multi-modal models [ 10, 12 ], which leverage multiple
data modalities to improve video description generation.
Previous work [ 7 ] investigated the use of natural language queries
to locate signal log information with the support of video data. However, the approach only utilized a single image frame from each
short video sequence, failing to fully exploit the temporal information available in the video. Relying on static images rather than full
video omitted critical motion cues—such as distinguishing between
moving and stationary states—thereby limiting the expressiveness
and accuracy of the generated descriptions. Moreover, this study


was based on just 80 records across 10 scenarios, which were specifically chosen to contain events observable in the signal data. While
the initial results were promising, the limited size and diversity
of the dataset constrained a thorough evaluation of the method’s
performance and generalizability.
We contribute to our previous work in several key aspects. First,
we utilize a different dataset that is openly accessible and approximately 20 times larger than that used in prior studies, significantly
enhancing the external validity of our findings. Second, we employ
alternative architectures designed to fully leverage the temporal
dynamics of video data, rather than relying on a single frame per
sequence. Lastly, we scale up the generation process by incorporating a broader set of scenarios that are commonly encountered in
real-world practice and span a wide range of difficulty levels.

**3** **Research Design**

**3.1** **Data Processing**

Zenseact Open Dataset (ZOD) consists of three subsets : Frames,
Sequences, and Drives, collected by test vehicles over two years
across various European countries. All vehicles were equipped
with multiple sensors and cameras. The Frames subset contains
annotated camera and LiDAR data, which are outside the scope of
our research. Driver consists of 29 multi-minute sequences with
full sensor coverage. The volume of this subset is too small for our
research. We utilize the subsets – Sequences, which contains 1,473
records of 20-second test-driving sequences. They are in the format
of data triplets _<_ ID, signal data, and video data _>_ .

_**Signal Data:**_ The _vehicle_data_ file within the sequence dataset
corresponds to the signal data. During test drives, sensors generate
high-frequency data, which is processed into signals essential for
key vehicle systems. All signals are stored in hdf5 format and can
be accessed as parquet tables comprising:

  - _Vehicle_data_ : 19 signals regarding the vehicle status, for example, velocity and acceleration.

  - _Vehicle_control_data_ : 11 signals of vehicle control status, for
example, acceleration pedal, brake pedal.

  - _Satellite_data_ : 19 signals regarding the satellite data, for example, latitude and longitude.

All three tables will be filtered based on interpretability, with 14
columns being used in this analysis.

_**Video Data:**_ The dataset contains 1,473 video records captured
by the front camera, each represented as .jpg images. Each 20second video is captured at 10 Hz, yielding ten frames per second.
An example frame from record #000005 is shown in Figure 1. For
each record, we uniformly sample 32 frames from the video files to
fit the maximum inputs of the chosen model: LLaVA-NeXT-Video7B-hf . The reason for selecting this model is explained in detail in
Section 4.1.3.

All 1,473 records are used in this research, but the signal and
video data are not of the same duration for each record. We process
the signal data to match the video data’s time length. We demonstrate the data processing progress in Figure 2.
There are three tables for the signal data, vehicle data (VD),
vehicle control data (VCD), and satellite data (SD) each. These data
types were collected at different frequencies, resulting in varying

**4** **EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATIONS**

**4.1** **Description Generation**

_4.1.1_ _Prompts:_ To answer RQ1, we designed six prompts (shown
in Table 1) to generate descriptions using the LLaVa model. We
focused on this model because it supports both single conversations
(Prompt 1 - 4) and multi-run conversations (Prompt 5 - 6). Each
prompt provides more information than the previous one, allowing
us to assess how specific the prompt needs to be, to provide the
relevant query results.


**Figure 1: A video frame from record #000005**

table lengths. To standardize the data, we downsized all tables based
on the least frequent data, the satellite data. After reshaping, we
have a table with approximately 1,700 rows. The signals (columns)
that are difficult to interpret or remain constant are considered
noise and, therefore, removed from the study.

**3.2** **Scenario Query**

The scenario query processing pipeline (Figure 2) consists of two
major steps. The first step is the textual description generation process, which converts the signal and video into textual information
separately. The second step involves individually comparing the
query text with the video and signal descriptions and then combining the results. We filter these results to retrieve the top records
and, based on their IDs, locate the corresponding records in the
database.

_3.2.1_ _Video Description Generation._ This paper aims to maximize
the utility of video data by enabling the generation of detailed
descriptions based on video content. The dataset facilitates the
replication of our research and validation of the results. We selected
three models for their performance and functionality, which are
discussed in Section 4.1.3.

_3.2.2_ _Signal Description Generation._ Signal descriptions are created with the assistance of an industrial partner, using automated
programs to convert signals into textual descriptions. These signals
represent various properties of test drives, such as address, acceleration, and brake pedal input. Automated interpreters are preferred
over LLMs because most properties have fixed values; interpreters
provide faster and more accurate descriptions without relying on
model-based learning.

_3.2.3_ _Query Processing._ We use a sentence similarity model, _all-_
_MiniLM-L6-v2_ to match queries to the natural language descriptions.
This approach remains manageable and computationally cheap. The
_all-MiniLM-L6-v2_ [1] model, known for its efficiency, compares the
cosine similarity between the embeddings of queries and record
descriptions. This approach can help save storage space when the
number of records are limited.

_4.1.2_ _Data Modalities:_ To analyze how data modalities impact
description generation, we use the same model ( LLaVa ) and prompts
to generate descriptions for the same record using image and video
data. This model is chosen for its ability to process both modalities.
By comparing descriptions generated from a single video frame
versus an entire video, we aim to identify differences and determine
the one that provides clearer and more reliable information about
the records.

_4.1.3_ _Models:_ In this study, we examine three models for video
description generation, as detailed in the following paragraphs. All
three models, launched in 2024, can generate textual information
from video.

_LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B-hf._ ( LLaVa ) [ 23 ]: This model was finetuned using both image and video datasets. It was chosen for its
ability to effectively interpret both static figures and dynamic videos,
enabling us to compare the descriptions generated from each format
and analyze the differences. Additionally, it supports multiple conversation rounds with the model, allowing us to compare various
prompts.

_InternVideo2-Chat-8B._ ( InternVideo ) [ 18 ]: Built on the Mistral7B architecture [ 6 ], this model integrates an LLM with a videospecific module (BLIP), creating a VideoLLM capable of understanding and responding to video content effectively.

_Cogvlm2-llama3-caption._ ( Cogvlm ) [ 19 ]: Based on LLaMa-3.18B [ 1 ], this model specializes in generating descriptive text for
videos. It excels at capturing and clearly articulating motion features, particularly for analyzing dynamic content.

**4.2** **Scenarios Query**

To verify the query results and examine how keywords affect the
outcomes, we developed nine scenarios as listed in Table 2, ranging
from simple to complex, with suggestions from developers at the
collaborating company.
These scenarios were selected based on several factors. First, we
considered the complexity and diversity of the scenarios to ensure
they reflect a range of real-world applications. Second, feedback
from developers helped us prioritize scenarios that are practical
and relevant to actual usage. Third, we ensured that the chosen
keywords were searchable within the dataset. Lastly, we aimed
for the scenarios to cover both signal data (e.g., locations and addresses) and video data (e.g., weather and vehicles). Through these
experiments, we address RQ2.

**4.3** **Validation Metrics**

One of the challenges in this work is evaluation, as the data lacks
labels, making it difficult to determine whether we have found the
best match for our query. However, during this study, we discovered
that although direct evaluation is not feasible, we can still assess
reliability by comparing the distance between the query and the
matched record and the distances between the query and other
records. We denote all records as being randomly labeled from 1
to 1473. Let _𝐷_ _𝑛_ represent the distance between the query and the
record labeled _𝑛_ . We define the gap between consecutive distances

as

_𝐺_ _𝑛_ = _𝐷_ _𝑛_ +1 − _𝐷_ _𝑛_ (1 ≤ _𝑛_ ≤ 1472) _,_

To quantitatively evaluate the architectures and retrieval quality
across different scenarios, we employed and evaluated the following
metrics to answer RQ3:



  - LGap (The Largest Gap): Represents the largest distance between two consecutive records, denoted as _𝐿𝐺𝑎𝑝_ = max ( _𝐺_ _𝑛_ ) _._
Larger gaps indicate low similarity between the generated
descriptions.

  - MinD (Min Distance): The distance between the query and
the most similar record, reflecting how far the query deviates
from the most similar generated description. Denoted as
_𝑀𝑖𝑛𝐷_ = min ( _𝐷_ _𝑛_ ) _._

  - MaxD (Max Distance): The distance between the query and
the least similar record, reflecting how far the query deviates
from the least similar generated description. Denoted as
_𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐷_ = max ( _𝐷_ _𝑛_ ) _._

  - Range: The difference between MaxD and MinD indicates
the range of similarity among the generated descriptions.
A smaller difference suggests that most records are fairly
similar to the query, while a larger difference indicates a
greater diversity in how records relate to the query.

  - StdDev (Standard Deviation): The standard deviation of distances across all records. A low standard deviation suggests
most descriptions are similar, while a higher standard deviation indicates greater diversity among the generated descrip
tions.

  - RLGap (Relative Largest Gap): Measures the largest gap in
distance between consecutive records, normalized by the
total range of distances. This provides a sense of how significant the largest gap is compared to the overall spread of
the data. A higher Relative Largest Gap suggests significant
differences in similarity among the records, indicating the
possible correct answers.

When querying a specific scenario, the criteria for a reliable
result includes:

  - A few highly relevant records with similarity scores above
0.9, demonstrating the pipeline’s ability to retrieve desired

scenarios.

EASE 2025, 17–20 June, 2025, Istanbul, Türkiye Sun et al.



  - Some irrelevant records should have similarity scores below
0.4, indicating the pipeline’s effectiveness in filtering out
unrelated responses.

  - The remaining records, with similarity scores between 0.4
and 0.9, should be distributed without forming distinct clusters. This spread reflects the pipeline’s ability to generate
varied descriptions for different scenarios.

A key indicator of a failed search is low variance. When all
records achieve similarly high or low scores, showing little distinction among descriptions.
To assess whether the query results follow this pattern, we can
visualize them using a violin plot with box plot, highlighting the
median and distribution of all records’ distances from the query.

**5** **Results**

**5.1** **RQ1**

_5.1.1_ _Prompts:_ To identify the effect of the prompts on the quality
of generated descriptions. We compared the six different prompts,
reviewed all generated text, and used record #000005 as an example
in this paper. We present the results by showcasing a single video
frame using Prompt 4 in Figure 3.
In Table 1, a multi-run-prompt consistently produced better descriptions than a single-line-prompt. Prompts 2 and 3 generated
repetitive phrases, a pattern also observed in other instances. Starting from Prompt 4, the generated descriptions became more concise
and clearer, without redundancy, and all information was directly
inferred from the records. The descriptions produced by Prompt 5
and 6 showed no significant differences.
We also generated violin plots for each prompt, as illustrated in
Figure 4. From the perspective of prompts:

  - Prompt 4 generates the most reliable results. Its longer whiskers
indicate a greater spread of data. Compared to other prompts,
it has long needle-like shapes at both ends, suggesting some
highly relevant (> 0.9) and less relevant (< 0.4) candidates.
The lowest score is around 0.2 (Scenario VI), and the highest
is close to 1 (Scenario IV). In the middle range (0.4–0.9), it
demonstrates a well-distributed variance.

  - Prompts 1, 2, and 3 struggle to identify highly relevant
records (> 0.9) and fail to effectively filter out irrelevant
ones (< 0.4). While they show good variance, they lack both
high (> 0.9) and low (< 0.4) scores. Their median values are
lower than those of Prompts 4, 5, and 6.

  - Prompts 5 and 6 exhibit very low variance, with flat plots
and no scores below 0.4, indicating that the generated descriptions are highly similar. Across all prompts, Prompt 5
and Prompt 6 exhibit higher median scores. This suggests
that both prompts generate a large amount of information,
making it more challenging to precisely match the query to
the records.

Overall, multi-run prompts produced more concise and accurate
descriptions than single-run prompts, while Prompt 4 offers a more
cost-efficient option.

_5.1.2_ _Data Modality:_ To assess the impact of data modality on the
quality of generated descriptions, we showcased the description


produced for a specific frame from the same video (#000005). Using
prompt 4, the generated description is:

From the perspective of the vehicle’s speed, it seems
to be maintaining a steady pace, which is appropriate for the conditions. The acceleration and braking
patterns are not clearly visible, but the car appears
to be maintaining a consistent speed without sudden
acceleration or deceleration. The road ahead is clear,
and there are no signs of heavy traffic or congestion,
which indicates that the driver is likely following the
speed limits and driving responsibly. The environmental factors include a cloudy sky, which might suggest overcast weather conditions, but no rain or snow
is visible, and the lighting is bright, indicating it is
daytime. The road is clear, with no visible debris or
obstacles, which is good for driving conditions. The
bridge’s suspension design is evident, and the car is

on.

However, this description includes details that cannot be inferred
from a still image, such as "appears to be maintaining a consistent
speed without sudden acceleration or deceleration," which requires
motion to be observed.

We also reviewed all the descriptions generated in Prompt 6
and observed several phrases that never appear in image-based
descriptions. For example, phrases like ’suggesting a slowing down’
and ’approaching an intersection’ demonstrate the ability to convey
motion, which marks an improvement over image descriptions.
The video description shown in Table 1 is clearer, more concise,
and easier to understand. Its lack of ambiguity, redundancy, and
unnecessary detail makes it more suitable for efficient communication. Since the video description contains most of the important
information in the image description, we do not consider adding
the image description as one of the inputs.

_5.1.3_ _Model:_ Based on our findings that Prompt 4 offers a more
cost-efficient option and that video data provides additional information not obtainable from image data, we used Prompt 4 and video
data to evaluate three selected models.

The results are shown in Figure 5. The plot generated by LLaVa
(bottom) exhibits superior clustering. The long needle-shaped extension at the top reflects its ability to identify highly relevant matches
(score > 0.9) while avoiding an overabundance of high-relevance
responses, a drawback of Cogvlm . Additionally, LLaVa incorporates lower-scoring candidates (< 0.4), demonstrating its ability to
filter out irrelevant responses—a weakness of InternVideo . The
middle score range (0.4–0.9) remains well-balanced compared to
InternVideo, preventing excessive high scores.

**RQ1:** Prompt 4 is a more cost-effective solution. Additionally, video
data contributes valuable information that is inaccessible through
~~image~~ ~~data~~ . ~~Among~~ ~~the~~ ~~models~~ ~~selected~~, ~~the~~ ~~LLaVa~~ ~~model~~ ~~generated~~
the most reliable descriptions, making it particularly suitable for
querying.

**5.2** **RQ2**

Nine scenarios were designed from simple, single-keyword cases
to more complex ones involving multiple keywords. As illustrated
in violin plots in Figure 4, we categorize the values as follows:

EASE 2025, 17–20 June, 2025, Istanbul, Türkiye Sun et al.


**Figure 5: All records’ distances across three models. The Y-**
**axis shows the distances between the search query and all**
**records. The X-axis is Scenario I to IX.**

  - Highly Relevant: The top narrow end. The top part of the
violin, where values cluster above 0.9, indicates high similarity.

  - Moderately Relevant: The wide middle section of the violin
plot (Value 0.4 - 0.9). This range includes responses with a
decent but imperfect similarity to the reference.

  - Non-Relevant: The bottom narrow end. The bottom portion
of the violin represents responses with low similarity score
(< 0.4).

Scenario I and II are simple queries with only one keywords.
Scenario I reaches a maximum of 0.9 across different prompts, with [˜]
a median of 0.6. Prompts 4, 5, and 6 approach 0.7, while Prompt 3 [˜]
falls below 0.6. Prompt 4 producing the best shape plot. Scenario
II performs consistently well across all prompts, yielding highly
relevant candidates (>0.9). Prompts 2 and 4 also capture some nonrelevant responses (<0.4).
In Scenario III, the address "France" is inferred solely from signal
data and accurately reflected in the descriptions. However, there
are fewer highly relevant records compared to Scenario I and II.
Scenario IV performs well across all prompts, with the highest
median and a distinct long needle shape at the top (>0.9). The middle


range (0.4–0.9) is well-distributed with high variance. Scenario VI,
which contains multiple keywords, encounters the terms cloudy,
bridge, and cars more prominently observed in the video. It follows
a similar pattern to Scenario IV, indicating that the bottleneck lies
in feature detection rather than keyword count.
Scenario V contains more keywords than previous four scenarios, yet its median values across all prompts are lower. No records
exceed 0.9 in similarity score. Scenario VII also includes more keywords, but the "change from a dashed to a solid line" is difficult
to observe in the video. It has the lowest median score among all
scenarios, with no highly relevant matches (>0.9).
Scenario VIII and Scenario IX maintain consistently high similarity scores across prompts, while others fluctuate more. Scenario
IX has the most compact distribution, suggesting that generated
descriptions are highly similar, making it difficult to identify strong
matches. Rather than using multi-run conversation prompts, simpler prompts like prompts 3 and 4 might results in higher variance
value and make it easier to identify the good matches.
Overall, when the query is short, but the descriptions are long,
we noticed that the found records might not be so accurate. This
is due to the increased presence of similar records and the long
descriptions that can lower the similarity score, causing relevant
records to be excluded from the results. Second, when the keywords
are included in the descriptions but do not have the same semantic
meaning, we found that the query results might not be accurate.
For example, when the scenario III asks for pedestrians, it will find
some records with descriptions of "no pedestrians."
We also developed an API to perform queries and visualize the
results by displaying a video frame. This allows us to manually
verify if the results match the queried scenarios. As mentioned,
there are no established benchmarks for evaluating the results,
a key challenge in this research. Using images helps verify visually identifiable features, such as snow or traffic lights, typically
captured in the video data. However, some features, like speed or
location, require manual checking of the signal data. We illustrate
the Scenario I (Figure 6) and IX (Figure 7) as they are the best and
worst case according to the curve analysis.

**RQ2:** Short queries combined with long descriptions will lower
the similarity score, which can lead to the exclusion of relevant
records from the retrieval results. Additionally, the results often lack
~~accuracy~~ ~~when~~ ~~keywords~~ ~~are~~ ~~present~~ ~~in~~ ~~the~~ ~~descriptions~~ ~~but~~ ~~do~~ ~~not~~
align semantically with the query. This highlights the importance
of both query length and semantic consistency in optimizing data
retrieval quality and effectiveness

**5.3** **RQ3**

In addition to visualizing the records, we qualitatively analyze the
results. The results of all experiments are summarized in Table 3.
From the largest gap, we infer that as prompts become more detailed, the descriptions initially become more diverse but show
diminishing differences after a certain point. In our experiments,
most architectures exhibited the greatest diversity with prompt 4,
which had the largest gap. This is likely linked to the length of the
descriptions, as more detailed prompts tend to generate longer ones.

**Figure 6: Query results for scenario I using prompts 1 to 6 (from left to right)**

**Figure 7: Query results for scenario IX using prompts 1 to 6 (from left to right)**


Additionally, starting with prompt 4, a fixed format was enforced,
possibly contributing to the lower gap scores and reduced diversity
afterward.

We also calculated the maximum and minimum distances be
tween the query and the records. Prompt 4 yielded both the highest
and lowest distances. We further confirmed this by calculating the
range, observing that Prompt 4 achieved the highest range across
all scenarios. Regarding standard deviation, we found that in all
scenarios, Prompts 5 and 6 had lower standard deviations than
the previous prompts. For RLGap, the highest values occurred at
different prompts. Prompt 4 achieved the highest value in four of
the nine scenarios, indicating that all the generated descriptions
exhibited better diversity and significant differences, a positive sign
for accurate matching.

**RQ3:** Although there are no direct benchmarks for evaluating query
results, reliable outcomes typically display consistent patterns. First,
when plotting the sorted distances for all records, an ’S’ shape
typically emerges, helping to distinguish three categories: highly
relevant, moderately relevant, and non-relevant items. Additionally,
various metrics can be used to assess the quality of the results. A
wide range of values and significant gaps between them generally
indicate a successful match.

**6** **Discussion**

Our study provides valuable insights for autonomous driving software companies, particularly in log storage optimization and retrieval for software testing. Test driving logs and associated data
are primarily used for short-term development iterations with limited long-term utility. However, as simulation and cloud services
evolve, more effective data retention and utilization strategies must
be explored. Our research demonstrates that leveraging LLMs can
significantly enhance log retrieval efficiency, reducing the workload of developers and enabling more effective use of historical log
information. By integrating LLMs into log management systems,
companies can streamline debugging, improve software validation,
and accelerate development cycles.
**Limitation:** One limitation of this study is the publicly available
and relatively small dataset. Given the limited scale, we could store
and retrieve log descriptions through direct comparison without a
significant computational overhead. However, as the scale of data

costs. Additionally, once descriptions are generated, annotating and
categorizing the data based on commonly used keywords should
be considered to facilitate easier access for developers in real-world
practice.
Another limitation is the availability of signal data in the dataset.
In practice, the number of signal data points is significantly larger
than that publicly accessible in open datasets. In real-world applications, to maximize the utility of signal data, it is necessary to
categorize them into discrete and continuous values. By leveraging LLMs, we can analyze continuous values more effectively and
generate descriptions that better capture trends over time. Developing robust methods to process and interpret these signal data will
be crucial for improving the performance and applicability of log
retrieval systems.
**Future Work:** In future research, we aim to improve the dynamic description of signal data, particularly for continuously
changing signals, to better capture trends and patterns over time.
Additionally, we plan to enhance the architecture of the query engine by exploring more advanced sentence similarity models. Due
to resource constraints, we could not train a customized model for
this study; however, access to larger and more diverse open datasets
could enable the development of tailored models with improved
performance. Exploring these advancements will further refine the
potential of LLMs in autonomous driving software testing and log
management.

**7** **Threads to Validity**

A threat to **internal validity** arises in selecting prompts and
scenario-based search queries. We mitigate this by using a broader
range of prompts and queries and incorporating real-world scenarios from industry practice. As a threat to **external validity**,
evaluating the proposed pipeline against one open dataset may
limit generalizability. Nonetheless, the selected dataset is the only
publicly available dataset with paired video and signal records from
our knowledge. We minimize this threat by relying on the expertise of our collaborating industry partner. A threat to **conclusion**
**validity** stems from data sourced from a single company and collected only within European countries. We address this by selecting
scenarios based on diverse criteria to enhance representativeness.

**8** **Conclusions**

In this work, we explored the potential of combining video data
with signal data to enhance data querying and improve log retrieval
in autonomous driving applications. We studied factors affecting
description generation and found that video data produces more
trustworthy and concise descriptions than image data alone. While
multi-run prompts can generate more detailed descriptions, they
may reduce query accuracy, as overly long descriptions can be less
effective when dealing with short queries. A more cost-efficient
approach, such as Prompt 4 in our study, provides a balanced tradeoff between detail and accuracy. Among the models evaluated,
LLaVa performed the best, demonstrating strong capabilities in
identifying highly relevant cases while effectively filtering out nonrelevant ones.

We identified challenges in detecting keywords related to signal
data or motion-related features, which can lead to false positives,


through nine evaluated scenarios. In contrast, keywords associated
with video data were easier to detect, though the model occasionally struggled with semantic confusion and the misinterpretation
of negation. To support practical implementation, we developed an
API that visualizes query results, integrating curve plots as indicators of search quality alongside various metrics to assess retrieval
accuracy and overall effectiveness.
Since no established metrics exist for evaluating this problem,
we introduced range, standard deviation, and relative gap to quantitatively measure results. These proved to be effective evaluation
metrics. Additionally, violin plots combined with box plots offer
a clear visualization of query reliability. Integrating these visualizations with video frames enables developers to better assess and
validate the scenarios they are searching for.
Our findings highlight the advantages of integrating video and
signal data for more accurate and efficient log retrieval in autonomous driving applications. By identifying key challenges in
description generation and query accuracy, we provide insights
into optimizing prompt strategies and model selection, with LLaVa
emerging as the most effective option. Additionally, our proposed
evaluation metrics and visualization techniques offer a practical
framework for improving search reliability, aiding developers in
scenario analysis and system refinement. Future research can build
upon our approach by refining retrieval models, incorporating
larger datasets, and exploring advanced methods for better-integrating
signal and video data.
