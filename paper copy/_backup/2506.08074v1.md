Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language
models in external evidence, yet it still falters when answers must
be pieced together across semantically distant documents. We close
this gap with the Hierarchical Lexical Graph (HLG), a three-tier index that (i) traces every atomic proposition to its source, (ii) clusters
propositions into latent topics, and (iii) links entities and relations
to expose cross-document paths. On top of HLG we build two
complementary, plug-and-play retrievers: StatementGraphRAG,
which performs fine-grained entity-aware beam search over propositions for high-precision factoid questions, and TopicGraphRAG,
which selects coarse topics before expanding along entity links
to supply broad yet relevant context for exploratory queries. Additionally, existing benchmarks lack the complexity required to
rigorously evaluate multi-hop summarization systems, often focusing on single-document queries or limited datasets. To address this,
we introduce a synthetic dataset generation pipeline that curates
realistic, multi-document question-answer pairs, enabling robust
evaluation of multi-hop retrieval systems. Extensive experiments
across five datasets demonstrate that our methods outperform naive
chunk-based RAG, achieving an average relative improvement of
23.1% in retrieval recall and correctness. [1]

**1** **Introduction**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have gained attention for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external
knowledge, enabling more grounded and accurate responses to complex questions [ 13, 17 ]. Despite these advances, current RAG systems face significant challenges with multi-hop reasoning, where
answers may be synthesized from multiple, semantically diverse
text segments or documents [ 21 ]. For example, consider the query:
_‘How did the FTC lawsuit affect the stock of one of the leading e-_
_commerce companies?’_ This requires retrieving facts about the lawsuit, Amazon’s financial performance, and market reactions, likely
dispersed across multiple, unconnected documents.
Most RAG systems struggle in such scenarios because they rely
primarily on vector similarity search (VSS). While VSS excels at
finding texts that closely match the query’s surface-level semantics,
it often fails to bridge related but contextually distant pieces of
information [ 5 ]. In the previous example, connecting ‘company
lawsuit details’ from one document with ‘stock performance data’
in another may require structured links or graph-based expansions,
as they lack obvious semantic ties. Graph-based retrieval strategies provide a promising solution as they model explicit edges,
such as shared entities or discourse links, thereby overcoming the
narrowness of vector-based methods [10, 12, 14].

KDD ’25, August 3–7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada Abdellah Ghassel et al.


In addition, we emphasize the importance of retrieval-unit granularity. Conventional systems often utilize large text chunks, consisting of various sentences, leading to the retrieval of extraneous
information. To address this, Chen et al . [7] advocate for smaller
retrieval units, such as atomic propositions, to enhance precision
in information retrieval.

Building on these insights, we propose a Hierarchical Lexical
Graph (HLG) framework to address the gap between surface-level
similarity and structured multi-hop evidence. While prior work
emphasizes the benefits of finer retrieval units [ 7 ], HLG extends
these ideas by integrating three interconnected tiers: Lineage, Summarization, and Entity-Relationship. Specifically, HLG (1) preserves
the lineage of each statement for accurate provenance, (2) clusters
statements around topics for flexible retrieval, and (3) links entities and relationships to enable bottom-up graph traversal. This
multi-tier design enables more precise retrieval of diverse facts,
even when they share minimal semantic overlap.
Using this framework, we propose two complementary RAG
methods tailored to different retrieval needs:

  - **StatementGraphRAG** focuses on individual propositions
in the Summarization Tier. It links them across documents

using the Entity-Relationship Tier and preserves provenance
via the Lineage Tier. This is ideal for detailed queries needing
high-precision evidence (e.g., factoid questions).

  - **TopicGraphRAG** retrieves clusters of statements (i.e., topical groups) from the Summarization Tier, using entity relationships to connect thematically related clusters and relying
on the Lineage Tier for source traceability. This is efficient
for broader, open-ended or higher-level queries.

The choice depends on query type: StatementGraphRAG for specific, single-answer queries, and TopicGraphRAG for exploratory
or multi-faceted questions.
Despite the promise of these approaches, a major obstacle remains: most existing QA datasets fail to demand true multi-hop
retrieval, either restricting questions to single documents or offering a small set of queries. WikiHowQA [ 6 ], for example, focuses on
single-document responses, while the SEC10Q [ 15 ] dataset contains
only 195 queries. To address this gap, we present a synthetic multihop summarization pipeline using HLG as a backbone. We generate
674 question-answer pairs from the MultiHop-RAG corpus [ 21 ],
then apply a second-pass LLM critique and automated retrieval
checks [ 19 ] to ensure each question genuinely requires multi-hop
inference and has sufficient supporting evidence.
Our paper makes the following contributions:

(1) We introduce StatementGraphRAG and TopicGraphRAG,
advancing multi-hop QA with fine-grained and structured
retrieval capabilities.
(2) We develop a pipeline synthesizing high-quality multi-hop
summarization queries, closing gaps in existing benchmarks.
(3) Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, we
show significant performance gains over chunk-based RAG
baselines.


**2** **Related Work**

**2.1** **Multi-hop Reasoning with Graphs**

Graph-based approaches have been actively used in modelling relationships required for effective multi-hop reasoning. Fang et al . [12]
introduced the Hierarchical Graph Network (HGN) for multi-hop
question answering, which integrates nodes of varying granularity
including questions, paragraphs, sentences, and entities using graph
neural networks. This facilitates joint prediction of answers and
supporting facts by enabling multi-hop information propagation
across different levels of the graph. However, HGN faces significant
limitations that hinder its scalability and generalizability. First, the
storage of embeddings across multiple granularities incurs substantial memory and computational overhead, particularly for large
datasets. Second, its reliance on explicit relational structures, such
as Wikipedia hyperlinks, restricts its applicability to domains where
such curated connections are sparse. Our HLG extends HGN’s foundational concepts by embedding both fine-grained propositions and
higher-level topics within a unified graph structure.
Edge et al . [11] proposed GraphRAG, a graph-indexing method
designed for global summarization tasks. By constructing an entityrelation knowledge graph and hierarchically detecting communities on the graph, GraphRAG enables summarization at indexing time. However, its reliance on pre-defined entities and static
Leiden-generated communities [ 22 ] poses limitations for dynamically expanding domains. Incorporating additional data requires
recalculating the community structure for the entire graph, which
can be computationally expensive. In contrast, HLG is designed
for continuous data ingestion and supports multiple granularity
tiers, facilitating more efficient updates and robust retrieval. Rather
than relying on pre-computed communities, HLG dynamically retrieves relevant topics at query time, enabling greater scalability
and resource efficiency.

**2.2** **Dense Retrieval Granularity**

Chen et al . [7] analyze how the granularity of retrieval units affects
dense retrieval. Their findings indicate that fine-grained propositions outperform larger units (e.g., sentences or passages) in both
retrieval precision and downstream task performance. While Chen
et al . [7] focus on dense retrieval for standard datasets, we extend
this principle by integrating hierarchical graph structures to ensure
relevance and connectivity across diverse sources. To enhance the
adaptability of statement extraction for structured and tabular data
(such as SEC filings), an LLM-modified version of the propositionizer (propositionizer-wiki-flan-t5-large) was incorporated.

**3** **Hierarchical Lexical Graph**

The design of our RAG solution is driven by a systematic "working
backward" approach that, given a workload’s question-answering
needs, identifies optimal retrieval and generation strategies and
appropriate indexing and storage systems in support of those needs.
In this design, consideration is given to the types of end-user or
application-specific data needs the workflow is intended to support,
the data required to meet these needs, and the indexing structures best suited for efficient retrieval. HLG is constructed once

per dataset during initial indexing to optimize relevance for the

This tier is useful in compliance-driven scenarios, where maintaining the original context and source of retrieved information is
critical for interpretability.

_3.1.2_ _Entity-Relationship Tier._ Captures relationships between entities, serves as an entry point for structured, keyword-based searches.

                                - **Entity Nodes** : Key entities (e.g., "Amazon") classified by
category (e.g., "Company").

                                - **Relationship Edges** : Inter-entity relationships (e.g., "FILED
LAWSUIT AGAINST"), for structured retrieval tasks.

This tier supports complex aggregation queries, such as _"Which_
_companies filed lawsuits in Q3 2023?"_, while dynamically incorporating new classifications to enhance adaptability.

_3.1.3_ _Summarization Tier._ Links granular facts and statements to
broader topics, forming hierarchical semantic units.

target domain. However, HLG supports incremental ingestion of
new documents and entity propagation without full reindexing,
due to modular updates in its tiers (Section 3.1).

**3.1** **Statement Retrieval and Graph Structures**

Determining the optimal size and structure of retrieval units is
critical in search-based workflows. Traditional RAG systems often
rely on text "chunks" (segments larger than sentences, smaller than
documents). However, such coarse-grained units frequently amalgamate unrelated sentences, reducing precision. In contrast, our
system centers on "propositions" (standalone assertions extracted
from text) as the primary retrieval unit. This granularity allows for
precise, contextually relevant inputs for LLMs.
The retrieval system is built upon a lexical graph model, illustrated in Figure 1, comprising three interconnected tiers that enable
fine-grained connectivity across documents.

_3.1.1_ _Lineage Tier._ Establishes the foundation of the graph, ensuring traceability and contextual integrity.

  - **Source Nodes** : Metadata such as document origin, date, and
author information, for provenance.

  - **Chunk Nodes** : Sequentially linked text segments, preserving context for further analysis and maintaining lineage.



  - **Facts** : Discrete semantic units (subject-predicate-object triplets)
that connect granular and global insights.

  - **Statements** : Propositions extracted from source documents,
forming the backbone of the retrieval process.

  - **Topics** : Thematic summaries grouping related statements,
enhancing intra-document connectivity.

By connecting statements to overarching topics, this tier facilitates both local and global reasoning, ensuring efficient retrieval
strategies for multi-hop QA tasks.

**3.2** **Graph Connectivity**

HLG optimizes retrieval through a hybrid approach that combines
semantic similarity and graph traversal, ensuring flexible and efficient navigation across the graph:

(1) **Local/Global Connectivity** : Topics provide intra-document
connectivity by linking statements within a source. In contrast, facts enable inter-document connections, ensuring
comprehensive retrieval for complex queries.
(2) **Vector-Based Entry Points** : Both topics and/or statements
are embedded for vector-based searches, enabling precise
semantic similarity matching. Topic embeddings incorporate
associated statements to enhance query alignment.
(3) **Keyword-Based Entry Points** : Query keywords can be
matched with entities in the Entity-Relationship Tier, essential for bottom-up lookups.

**4** **Proposed Retrieval Models**

Two methods leverage HLG: StatementGraphRAG (Section 4.1) and
TopicGraphRAG (Section 4.2). The choice between them depends
on the query’s nature. StatementGraphRAG excels at precise, factbased queries seeking specific information, often with a single
expected answer. Its fine-grained statement retrieval and entity
linking ensure high precision. TopicGraphRAG is better for broader,
exploratory queries or those requiring synthesis across multiple
themes. Its topic-level retrieval provides wider context, suitable for
open-ended questions or summarization tasks.

**4.1** **StatementGraphRAG**

**Overview.** The StatementGraphRAG pipeline has four components,
designed to progressively refine search results:

KDD ’25, August 3–7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada Abdellah Ghassel et al.


(1) _Keyword-Based Retrieval_ : Extracts query terms and retrieves
statements with those terms via explicit entity matching.
(2) _Vector Similarity Search_ : Retrieves statements semantically
similar to the query.
(3) _Graph Beam Search_ : Explores multi-hop neighbours in HLG
by traversing shared entities, and scoring resulting paths.
(4) _Reranking_ : Rescores all candidates to finalize top- _𝑘_ results.

**Notation.** Let _𝑄_ ∈D be the user query and

e _𝑄_ := Embed( _𝑄_ ) ∈ R _[𝑑]_

its _𝑑_ -dimensional embedding. Let G = ( _𝑉, 𝐸_ ) be the lexical graph
and S G ⊆ _𝑉_ the set of statement nodes. Define the set of extracted
keywords (and synonyms):

_𝐾_ = { _𝑘_ _𝑖_ | _𝑘_ _𝑖_ extracted from _𝑄_ } _,_ _𝑖_ = 1 _, . . ., 𝑁_ _𝑘_ _._ (1)

_Step 1: Keyword Retrieval._ For _𝑠_ ∈S G, let _𝐾_ _𝑠_ ⊆ _𝐾_ be the keywords
whose entities appear in _𝑠_ . We rank statements by:

Score kw ( _𝑠_ ) = | _𝐾_ _𝑠_ | _,_ (2)

breaking ties with cosine similarity sim( e _𝑄_ _,_ e _𝑠_ ) . The _𝑘_ highestscoring statements form:

S kw = Top _𝑘_ �S G _,_ Score kw � _._ (3)

_Step 2: Vector Similarity Search._ In parallel to Step 1, we retrieve:

S vss = Top _𝑘_ � _𝑠_ ∈S G | sim(e _𝑄_ _,_ e _𝑠_ )� _._ (4)

The initial candidate set is the union, S init = S kw ∪S vss _._

_Step 3: Graph Beam Search._ For a statement _𝑠_, define its neighbours
by shared entities:

Nbr( _𝑠_ ) = � _𝑠_ [′] ∈S G | Ent( _𝑠_ ) ∩ Ent( _𝑠_ [′] ) ≠ ∅� _._ (5)

Given a path _𝑃_ = ⟨ _𝑠_ 1 _, . . .,𝑠_ _𝑛_ ⟩, we compute an attention-weighted
path embedding [4]:


� _𝑛𝑗_ =1 [exp][�][sim][(][e] _[𝑄]_ _[,]_ [ e] _[𝑠]_ _[𝑗]_ [)][�] _[.]_ (6)


e path ( _𝑃_ ) =


∑︁ _𝑛_ _𝛼_ _𝑖_ e _𝑠_ _𝑖_ _,_ _𝛼_ _𝑖_ = _𝑛_ exp [�] sim(e _𝑄_ _,_ e _𝑠_ _𝑖_ ) [�]

14: S top ← Top _𝑘_ �S final _,_ Score rank �

15: **return** S top

**4.2** **TopicGraphRAG**

**Overview.** _TopicGraphRAG_ integrates both top-down (topic-driven)
and bottom-up (entity-driven) retrieval to identify and expand thematically relevant information through multi-hop reasoning. Topics
typically map to a small number of chunks (1:n, where n is small),
often from the same document. This makes the approach more
storage-efficient than retrieving isolated statements, which tend to
have a 10:1 chunk-to-statement ratio. The pipeline consists of four
stages, balancing broad thematic coverage with precise detail:

(1) **Top-Down: Topic Discovery.** Embed the query to identify
high-level topics aligned with user intent, then retrieve the
relevant statements linked to those topics.
(2) **Bottom-Up: Entity Exploration.** Extract query-related
keywords and match them with associated entities in the
lexical graph. Then, retrieve their associated statements.
(3) **Graph Beam Search.** Topic- and entity-related statements
are merged. A beam search explores additional context in
multiple hops, guided by a reranker at each step.
(4) **Final Rerank & Truncation.** Rescore all candidate statements using a reranker, and select the top- _𝑘_ relevant ones.

**Rationale.** Using _topics_ (top-down) and _entities_ (bottom-up), TopicGraphRAG broadens coverage while preserving precision. Multihop traversal explores cross-document links, and the final reranking
yields a set of statements well-aligned with the user query.

**4.3** **Post-Retrieval Processing**

After performing retrieval using StatementGraphRAG or TopicGraphRAG, post-processing can enhance diversity and clarity.

_4.3.1_ _Statement Diversity: Reducing Redundancy._ In many realworld scenarios, multiple sources may report overlapping information, which can constrain the context window. To address this, a
diversity filtering procedure identifies similar statements and preserves the highest-scoring representative. Empirical evaluations


Path relevance is:

Score beam ( _𝑃_ ) = sim [�] e _𝑄_ _,_ e path ( _𝑃_ ) [�] _._ (7)

Starting from each initial state _𝑠_ ∈S init, beam search expands
the frontier until either (i) no child improves the score or (ii) the
maximum depth _𝐷_ max is reached. At every depth, it keeps only the
_𝐵_ highest-scoring paths, ranked by Eq. (7). This procedure yields:

S beam = � BeamSearch( _𝑠,_ G _, 𝐵, 𝐷_ max ) _._ (8)

_𝑠_ ∈S init

The candidate pool after graph exploration is: S final = S init ∪S beam _._

_Step 4: Reranking._ Each _𝑠_ ∈S final is rescored by a cross-encoder
reranker:

Score rank ( _𝑠_ ) = sim [�] Rerank( _𝑄_ ) _,_ Rerank( _𝑠_ ) [�] _._ (9)

We return the top- _𝑘_ results:

S top = Top _𝑘_ �S final _,_ Score rank � _._ (10)

(Table 2) show a diversity threshold ( _𝜏_ ) as low as 0.5% can yield
modest gains with negligible overhead.

(1) **Preprocessing:** Numeric tokens are standardized, stop words
are removed, and text is lemmatized. This ensures consistent
representation of numeric and textual data.
(2) **Similarity Detection:** Vectorize statements via TF-IDF [ 20 ],
and compute cosine similarity to detect redundancies.


Sim( _𝑆_ _𝑖_ _,𝑆_ _𝑗_ ) =


� _𝑛𝑘_ =1 [TF-IDF] _[𝑆]_ _[𝑖]_ _[,𝑘]_ [·][ TF-IDF] _[𝑆]_ _[𝑗]_ _[,𝑘]_

_,_

_𝑛_ _𝑛_
~~√~~ ︃� _𝑘_ =1 [(][TF-IDF] _[𝑆]_ _[𝑖]_ _[,𝑘]_ [)] [2] [ ·] √︃� _𝑘_ =1 [(][TF-IDF] _[𝑆]_ _[𝑗]_ _[,𝑘]_ [)] [2]


where TF-IDF _𝑆_ _𝑖_ _,𝑘_ represents the _𝑘_ -th term in statement _𝑆_ _𝑖_,
and _𝑛_ is the total number of terms.

(3) **Filtering:** Define a _diversity threshold_ _𝜏_, which corresponds
to 1 − (similarity threshold) . Discard the lower-scoring statement and retain the more informative version:

Retain _𝑆_ _𝑖_ ⇔∀ _𝑆_ _𝑗_ : Sim( _𝑆_ _𝑖_ _,𝑆_ _𝑗_ ) _>_ (1− _𝜏_ ) ⇒ Score( _𝑆_ _𝑖_ ) _>_ Score( _𝑆_ _𝑗_ )

_4.3.2_ _Statement Enhancement: Tabular Data Processing._ For financial reports or documents with tabular data, this step enriches
statements by incorporating context from their text chunks. This is
important for sources like SEC-10Q filings, where numeric propositions may lack clarity without additional details. Relevant contextual information, such as column headers and row labels, are
appended to clarify the meaning of the data, improving the readability and interpretability of numeric propositions. This reduces
ambiguity (e.g., clarifying units or time periods), ensures completeness, and makes statements more accurate.

**5** **Synthetic Multi-Hop Summarization**

**Motivation.** Existing multi-hop summarization datasets, such as
SEC-10Q or WikiHow, lack the complexity or diversity required to
evaluate RAG systems. SEC-10Q has a limited set of 195 comprehensive queries, whereas WikiHow is not multi-hop since the answer
is derived from one text segment. To address these shortcomings,
we introduce a synthetic dataset generation pipeline that assembles
multi-hop queries spanning multiple documents, thereby testing
robust retrieval and summarization capabilities.

**5.1** **Dataset Characteristics**

  - **Complexity.** Each question needs information from two to
four documents (“hops”).

  - **Realism.** Queries mirror real-world inquiries that span multiple themes, needing deeper reasoning.

  - **Structure.** Each entry includes a multi-hop question, a ground
truth answer (from multiple chunks) and document snippets.
Ground truth answers are synthesized from multiple document snippets and validated for factual accuracy.

**5.2** **Pipeline Architecture**

Our dataset creation process uses a four-stage pipeline:

(1) **Topic Collection.** From a seed topic, we retrieve semantically related topics from different documents.
(2) **Chunk Selection.** Collect chunks from each relevant topic
(3-5 distinct articles) for cohesive context.


(3) **Query Generation.** Prompt an LLM with diverse chunks
to generate a multi-hop question. These questions require
synthesizing information across articles _(e.g., cause-effect,_
_contrasting perspectives, complementary insights)._
(4) **Critiquing and Refinement.** Queries are refined and validated by a second LLM pass to ensure clarity, coherence,
and multi-article coverage. Queries that fail validation, for
instance due to insufficient evidence, are discarded.

**Quality Control and Filtering.** In Step 4, we utilize a superior
LLM ( Claude-3.5 Sonnet v2 [ 2 ]) than the one used for querygeneration ( Claude-3 Sonnet [ 1 ]), to align better with human
judgement [16]. We incorporate a two-stage critique:

  - _Query Refinement:_ Each initial query-answer pair is examined to enhance clarity, address ambiguities, and enrich the
multi-hop nature (ensuring at least three distinct sources).

  - _Query Validation:_ Refined queries are paired with their associated document snippets and evaluated against the ground
truth. An internal retriever pipeline is used to simulate the
reasoning path. A query is accepted only if the system can
reconstruct the ground truth from the provided snippets, indicating sufficient evidence coverage and reasoning fidelity.

**5.3** **Dataset Statistics**

Using the MultiHop-RAG Corpus [ 21 ], we initially generated 1,173
questions and retained 674 high-quality queries after filtering. On
average, each query spans 4.1 chunks and 3.4 documents (4 entities
per question and 9 entities per answer).

_Sample Synthetic Query._

_How has Manchester United’s on-field performance un-_
_der Erik ten Hag evolved amid the impending Ratcliffe_
_ownership transition, considering their pressing statis-_
_tics, Champions League failure, and potential manage-_
_rial succession plans?_

**Ground-truth answer** : _"Manchester United’s current situation_

_reflects a complex intersection of tactical evolution and organizational_
_transition. While Ten Hag has shown some statistical improvements in_
_certain areas—notably with United ranking at the top of the Premier_
_League in high ball regains and middle-third possession win..."_
This demands the system’s ability to integrate performance metrics (pressing and possession statistics), organizational context
(ownership transition), and multi-document references (Champions
League details, managerial prospects).

**6** **Experimental Setup**

We describe our experimental design, including datasets, indexing
procedures, retrieval approaches, and evaluation metrics.

**6.1** **Datasets**

Our experiments span five diverse datasets (Table 1), selected to
evaluate multi-hop reasoning, domain-specific language, and tabular/context integration:
**MultiHop-RAG** [ 21 ]. Multi-document QA dataset with queries
that require synthesizing evidence from multiple sources, covering
inference, temporal reasoning, comparisons, and null cases.

KDD ’25, August 3–7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada Abdellah Ghassel et al.


**SEC-10Q** [ 15 ]. Quarterly financial reports (Form 10-Q) from
publicly traded companies, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports include financial statements,
management discussions, and disclosures of market risks.
**ConcurrentQA** [ 3 ]. A multi-hop QA benchmark requiring reasoning across both public (Wikipedia) and private (emails) data
sources. It builds on HotpotQA [ 23 ] and evaluates the ability to
handle complex cross-domain queries.
**NTSB** [ 15 ]. Corpus of aviation accident and incident reports from
the National Transportation Safety Board. Each report details the
event date, location, aircraft involved, and probable causal factors.
**WikiHowQA** [ 6 ]. Derived from WikiHow articles, with communitygenerated questions, along with step-by-step procedures.

**6.2** **Indexing Steps**

All datasets undergo a four-step indexing procedure. Steps 2–3 rely
on an LLM ( Claude–3 Sonnet [ 1 ] used here) to relate domainrelevant entities and topics, with fine-grained propositions. We use
AWS Neptune Analytics for the graph store and AWS OpenSearch
for vector storage. At the time of writing, the framework also supports PostgreSQL with pgVector, FalkorDB, and MosaicML.

(1) **Chunking.** Each document is segmented into 300-token
chunks, with a 20% overlap to preserve context.
(2) **Domain-Adaptive Refinement.** We sample five chunks
from each dataset to infer domain-specific entity types and
topics (e.g., financial terminology in SEC-10Q). This ensures
that HLG reflects relevant domain concepts.
(3) **Proposition & Graph Construction.** From each chunk, we
extract fine-grained propositions, and then link them with
topics, entities, and relationships in HLG.
(4) **Embedding Generation.** Embeddings for topics, statements,
or both, per retrieval method. We use _Cohere-Embed-English-_
_v3_ to compute 1024-dimensional vectors [8].

**6.3** **Retrieval Approaches**

We evaluate three baseline methods and four HLG-based retrieval

approaches. For all methods, the context window is fixed at 10
chunks, which corresponds to approximately 3,000 tokens. Following retrieval, ( BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-minicpm-layerwise [ 18 ])
selects the final set of passages (chunks/statements). This reranker,
based on a streamlined 2B-LLM, processes queries and retrieved
statements jointly, enabling deeper context understanding compared to embedding-based methods that rely on fixed vector representations. All methods, including baselines, use the same LLM
( Claude-3 Sonnet [ 1 ]) and identical prompting for answer generation. We avoid techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
as they can conflate retrieval effectiveness with reasoning ability. Our focus is strictly on retrieval augmentation. Importantly,
Claude-3 Sonnet ’s training data was frozen in August 2023 [ 1 ],
predating the MultiHop-RAG articles (Sept-Dec 2023) [ 21 ]. Thus, its
performance on this dataset cannot be attributed to memorization.

_6.3.1_ _Baselines._



  - **Naive RAG** (B0). Retrieves 10 chunks via VSS. VSS uses a
dense retriever, applying k-nearest neighbour (kNN) algorithms to rank chunks based on the similarity between the
query and chunk embedding [9].

  - **Naive RAG (w/ reranking)** (B1). Retrieves 50 chunks initially, applies the reranking model, and prunes the output to
retain the top 10 chunks for the final set.

  - **Entity-Linking Expansion** (E1). A simpler graph-like baseline. Retrieves 5 chunks via VSS, expands with one-hop entity
links from HLG, merges up to 50 nodes (chunks associated
with linked entities), then reranks to top 10 chunks. This is
similar to the triplet extraction idea in some related works.

_6.3.2_ _Our Approaches._

  - **StatementRAG** (SRAG). Performs VSS on individual statements (rather than entire chunks). Retrieve 100 statements,
then reranks and truncates the top results.

  - **StatementGraphRAG** (SGRAG). Extends SRAG with graphbased expansions. Starting from 100 initial statements, we
run a beam search over graph neighbours (width=50, depth=3).
The expanded pool is reranked and truncated.

  - **TopicRAG** (TRAG). Retrieves 50 topics based on VSS. The
associated statements for each topic are retrieved. The statements are then reranked and truncated.

  - **TopicGraphRAG** (TGRAG). Combines topic-level retrieval
with graph expansions. First, retrieves 50 topics via VSS, expands using beam search (width=50, depth=3), and reranks.

**6.4** **Chunks as the Generation Unit**

In certain domains, compliance regulations mandate the use of
original text blocks rather than LLM-generated statements. To address this, we evaluate two HLG methods (SGRAG and TGRAG) in a
"chunk-based" variant. This approach leverages the detailed connections between individual statements during graph expansion, while
ensuring the generation prompt is composed solely of original text
blocks. In the final step, the top-ranked statements are traced back
to their source chunks. We select up to 10 unique chunks and apply a diversity filter to remove near-duplicates, further promoting
chunk-level diversity in the final output.

**6.5** **Evaluation Metrics**

**Correctness** is used for single-answer datasets (MultiHop-RAG,
SEC-10Q, ConcurrentQA) and **Answer Recall** for multi-answer
datasets (NTSB, WikiHowQA). _Correctness_ assesses if the generated
answer semantically contains all necessary information from the
gold answer, even if phrasing differs. For single-answer datasets,
correctness is akin to accuracy, requiring a semantically correct
response (e.g., a "true" response may be conceptually correct for
a "yes" ground truth, even if not an exact string match). This is
preferred over exact match, which can be overly rigid for free-form,
multi-part responses. _Answer Recall_ measures the proportion of gold
answer facts correctly included in the generated answer. For instance, listing 4 of 5 steps scores 0% on strict correctness but 80% on
recall. This captures partial coverage. For the synthetic dataset, we
evaluate the retrievers using claim recall (CR) and context precision
(CP) from RAGChecker [19].

**7** **Results**

We present retrieval evaluations across multiple datasets and metrics. We compare (a) chunk- vs. statement-level retrieval, (b) correctness vs. recall, and (c) pairwise comparisons against baselines.

**7.1** **Overall Retrieval Performance**

Table 2 reports results on three datasets with a single gold answer
(MultiHop-RAG, SEC-10Q, and ConcurrentQA) and two datasets
allowing multiple valid answers (NTSB, WikiHowQA).
**Discussion.** Among the baselines, B1 achieves 66.1% correctness
averaged over the three single-answer datasets, surpassing B0 by
4.1 absolute percentage points. E1, which performs simple entity
linking, shows minimal improvement over B1 on average (65.6%
correctness) and underperforms on SEC-10Q, suggesting that naive
entity expansion alone is not consistently beneficial. In contrast,
every HLG-based method (SRAG, SGRAG, TRAG, TGRAG, and their
variants) outperforms B1 in at least one dimension (correctness or
recall). SGRAG-0.5% attains the highest average correctness (73.6%),
an overall improvement of 7.5 points over B1. This method also
improves average answer recall (52.4%), up from 50.8% with B1.
On multi-answer tasks (NTSB and WikiHowQA), TGRAG yields
the best average recall (53.8%), outperforming SGRAG-0.5% by
1.4 absolute points. Meanwhile, statement-based methods such
as SRAG and SGRAG demonstrate consistently higher correctness
on single-answer datasets, with SRAG reaching 87.0% on MultiHopRAG and SGRAG-0.5% yielding 74.4% on SEC-10Q. These results
suggest that statement-level retrieval is adept at pinpointing a single correct piece of evidence, whereas topic-based retrieval may
capture a broader set of relevant facts. The WikiHowQA dataset
predominantly comprises single-hop, procedural questions (further
discussed in Appendix C.1.2). In such cases, multi-hop graph expansions (as in SGRAG/TGRAG) can introduce noise or irrelevant hops,
potentially degrading performance compared to simpler methods
like B1, which performs best on this dataset. While HLG-based
methods underperform slightly on WikiHowQA, they consistently
outperform baselines on all true multi-hop datasets (MultiHop-RAG,
ConcurrentQA). This dataset-specific behaviour shows that HLG is
optimized for multi-hop retrieval, and single-hop cases may benefit
from reduced complexity or early-stopping heuristics.

**7.2** **HLG Chunk-Based Variants**

Because some applications require preserving the original text at the
chunk level, we also evaluate Chunk-SGRAG and Chunk-TGRAG.


These methods internally retrieve statements using graph traversal,
but for the final output, they map the selected top statements back to
their parent chunks. Table 3 shows how these chunk-level variants
compare to the baselines.
**Discussion.** Relative to naive chunk-only retrieval (B0 or B1), the
hybrid chunk-based variants consistently yield higher correctness.
On ConcurrentQA, for example, Chunk-SGRAG-0.5% reaches 67.0%
correctness, a 23.7-point increase over B0 and 16.0 points over B1.
Despite initially retrieving content at the finer statement granularity, the final output remains chunked. This suggests that graphbased expansions are beneficial even if the generation context window must be text segments (chunks).

**7.3** **Synthetic Dataset Evaluation**

_7.3.1_ _RAGChecker Evaluation._ We further investigated retrieval
quality on our synthetic MultiHop-RAG subset using RAGChecker

[ 19 ], which provides fine-grained retriever metrics such as claim
recall (CR) and context precision (CP). Table 4 reports these metrics
for the baselines (B0, B1) and our primary HLG-based methods
(SGRAG, TGRAG). Generator metrics are omitted because all systems use the same LLM for answer generation.
**Discussion.** Although the baselines (B0, B1) show slightly higher
context precision (78.8%-81.5%), both SGRAG and TGRAG surpass
them in recall and F1. In particular, TGRAG achieves 49.3% recall and
47.9% F1, exceeding B1 by 3.0 and 1.6 absolute points, respectively.
The stronger claim recall (67.6% vs. 62.2% for B1) also showcases
TGRAG’s multi-hop capabilities, as it is more likely to gather all
relevant facts for each query.

_7.3.2_ _Pairwise Evaluation: Win Rates._ We also conducted a head-to
head comparison of SGRAG and TGRAG against the baselines. In
each comparison, an LLM evaluator was shown the two retrieved
answers in random order to mitigate any position bias. Table 5
presents the percentage of times each method won, lost, or tied.
**Discussion.** Both SGRAG and TGRAG significantly outperform
the chunk-based baselines, winning over 74% of head-to-head comparisons. TGRAG achieves a slightly higher win rate against B0
(78.3%) compared to SGRAG (74.8%), reflecting its stronger coverage
of multiple answers. These consistent pairwise improvements highlight that graph-based retrieval methods (whether statement- or
topic-centered) tend to produce more relevant and higher-quality
evidence than VSS retrieval.

**7.4** **Summary of Findings**

For single-answer tasks, statement-based retrieval methods (SRAG,
SGRAG) consistently achieve higher correctness, averaging 72.7%73.6%, compared to 62.0%-66.1% for naive baselines. In contrast,


topic-based approaches (TRAG, TGRAG) perform best on multianswer tasks. Graph expansions yield significant improvements:
SGRAG-0.5% exceeds the naive baseline (B0) by 8-12 points in
correctness across single-answer datasets, while TGRAG improves
answer recall by more than 10 points over B0 in multi-answer
settings. Introducing a modest diversity threshold (0.5%) further
enhances coverage by filtering near-duplicate statements, resulting
in an additional 1-point gain in correctness. Even when chunkbased outputs are used, leveraging statement-level graph traversals
internally enables retrieval of more relevant content, demonstrating
that fine-grained graph expansions enhance overall chunk selection.

**8** **Conclusion**

We presented a Hierarchical Lexical Graph framework that supports
fine-grained, multi-hop retrieval for QA tasks. Our experiments
demonstrated that statement-level and topic-level retrieval consistently outperform baselines across correctness, answer recall, and
pairwise judgements, with TopicGraphRAG especially strong in
multi-hop scenarios demanding broader coverage. The graph expansion strategies capture inter-document relationships more effectively, while a lightweight reranking model balances performance
with reduced latency. Despite higher indexing costs and domain
constraints, experimental results, including strong statement-tosource alignment, show viability for structured and unstructured
data. Future work will focus on refining proposition extraction with
smaller models, incorporating adaptive multi-hop detection, and
expanding domain specialization, thereby advancing the accuracy
and efficiency of multi-hop RAG systems in real-world applications.

_Average_ _96.0%_

Statement generation attains ≥ 96% accuracy, slipping only
slightly on table-centric sources. This confirms that our LLM-proposition
extractor still delivers high precision. SEC-10Q tables pose extra
hurdles, such as scattered units/periods and repetitive layouts that
split related details and blur entity links. The tabular enhancement
step (Section 4.3.2) restores context by attaching headers, units, and
other metadata to each extracted proposition.

Under AWS Bedrock prices (December 2024), end-to-end indexing with Claude-3 Sonnet for LLM inference and Cohere
Embed-English-v3 for embeddings costs $145.34. Running the
same workload in batch mode halves the LLM expenditure to $72.67
without affecting quality, and the embedding stage adds only $0.22.
Since boilerplate text (e.g., legal disclaimers) recurs across articles,
enabling caching lowers token counts and total spend even further.

_B.1.2_ _Retrieval Performance._ On a standard AWS g5.xlarge instance, an uncached query, covering passage retrieval, embedding
creation, and LLM call(s), completes in 20–30 s and costs $0.032.
Once the query’s vectors and LLM outputs are cached, the same
request is answered in well under one second with no additional
charge, meeting real-time requirements while keeping operating
costs minimal. Future work includes methods to recognize singlehop queries to avoid unnecessary multi-hop expansions, further
reducing costs and latency (Section C).

**C** **Limitations and Future Work**

**C.1** **Limitations**

_C.1.1_ _LLM Invocation and Indexing Costs._ HLG delivers high-fidelity
extractions, but at the cost of multiple LLM calls. Each chunk is
processed twice; first to extract statements, then to refine topics
and entities, so corpora with hundreds of millions of tokens accumulate substantial compute. These costs arise from building a finegrained knowledge graph that explicitly encodes topics, entities,
and relations. Expenses can be reduced by delegating the statement
extraction step to a lighter model such as _wiki-flan-t5-large_ (783 M
parameters) with little loss in retrieval quality. Because extraction
is performed once offline during index construction, online queries
add no further LLM latency.

_C.1.2_ _Single-Hop Domains and Early Stopping._ Our evaluation of
WikiHowQA highlights a minor regression for multi-hop graph
methods in single-hop contexts. When the query addresses a single
chunk of text, graph expansions can introduce extraneous statements or prolong retrieval. An early-stopping heuristic could detect
queries dominated by a single source document and return top- _𝑘_


statements directly from that source, improving efficiency and reducing noise.

_C.1.3_ _LLM Beam Search vs. Lightweight Reranking._ An early alternative to our BGE-based reranker was an LLM-driven beam search,
where each expansion step invoked a language model to rank expansions. This approach showed strong semantic alignment but was
prohibitively slow for practical use. Swapping to a lighter reranker
maintained strong performance gains while lowering latency, making graph-based methods viable in production environments.

**C.2** **Error Analysis**

We observe several recurring error modes:

_C.2.1_ _Over-Expansion._ Even with beam size limited to 3 expansions, queries with highly connected entities (i.e., supernodes) can
cause the pipeline to retrieve loosely related statements. Our entityoverlap ranking mitigates this by surfacing neighbours that share
more than one entity, but some out-of-scope expansions remain.

_C.2.2_ _Numeric/Tables Misalignment._ In SEC-10Q, numeric values
sometimes appear in multiple contexts. If two statements are semantically similar but reference different quarters, the top- _𝑘_ filtering
can inadvertently retrieve the wrong time period. This is especially
important for statement-level tabular enhancements (Section 4.3.2).

_C.2.3_ _Duplicate or Near-Duplicate Statements._ The same or nearly
identical facts can appear across different documents or versions
(especially in historical filings). Without diversity filtering, these
duplicates can dominate the top- _𝑘_ and reduce coverage. Our 0.5%
threshold helps alleviate this but does not fully eliminate overlapping data for heavily repeated claims.

**C.3** **Future Work**

_C.3.1_ _Propositionizer Pipelines._ Subsequent research will prioritize
the development of more efficient propositionization, reducing indexing tokens and LLM calls. Aligning the propositionizer’s output
with our knowledge-graph schema (topics/entities/relationships)
remains key to maintaining high-quality links.

_C.3.2_ _Hybrid Retrieval of Chunks and Statements._ We plan to explore a layered pipeline that first employs chunk-level searches to
localize relevant segments, followed by statement-level expansions
or reranking for multi-hop clarity. Such a hybrid approach might
preserve the speed of chunk-based retrieval while leveraging more
precise graph-based statements where necessary.

_C.3.3_ _Domain Specialization and Fine-Tuning._ Enhanced domain
adaptation, particularly within finance, healthcare, and legal corpora, may sharpen the extraction of domain-specific topics, entities,
and relations. Targeted fine-tuning of the reranker and propositionizer components in these specialized settings is expected to
improve precision while keeping inference costs manageable. Although we deliberately avoided highly specialized models in this
work to ensure broad applicability with general-purpose LLMs, we
are internally testing fine-tuned approaches for structured numeric
data (e.g., unit conversion tools, temporal linking improvements).
These are ongoing efforts to refine proposition extraction in complex, table-based contexts like legal or financial search.
