**作者**: Michael Glass, Gaetano Rossiello, Md Faisal Mahbub Chowdhury, Ankita Rajaram Naik, Pengshan Cai, Alfio Gliozzo

### 🎯 摘要
As demonstrated by GPT-3 and T5, transformers grow in capability as parameter spaces become larger and larger. However, for tasks that require a large amount of knowledge, non-parametric memory allows models to grow dramatically with a sub-linear increase in computational cost and GPU memory requirements. Recent models such as RAG and REALM have introduced retrieval into conditional generation. These models incorporate neural initial retrieval from a corpus of passages. We build on this line of ...

## 📄 论文2106.05346: End-to-End Training of Multi-Document Reader and Retriever for Open-Domain Question Answering (评分: 0.9037) - 快速分析

**作者**: Devendra Singh Sachan, Siva Reddy, William Hamilton, Chris Dyer, Dani Yogatama

### 🎯 摘要
We present an end-to-end differentiable training method for retrieval-augmented open-domain question answering systems that combine information from multiple retrieved documents when generating answers. We model retrieval decisions as latent variables over sets of relevant documents. Since marginalizing over sets of retrieved documents is computationally hard, we approximate this using an expectation-maximization algorithm. We iteratively estimate the value of our latent variable (the set of rel...

**作者**: Soyeong Jeong, Jinheon Baek, Sukmin Cho, Sung Ju Hwang, Jong C. Park

### 🎯 摘要
Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs), which incorporate the non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases into LLMs, have emerged as a promising approach to enhancing response accuracy in several tasks, such as Question-Answering (QA). However, even though there are various approaches dealing with queries of different complexities, they either handle simple queries with unnecessary computational overhead or fail to adequately address complex multi-step queries; yet, not all ...

**作者**: Dazhou Yu, Riyang Bao, Gengchen Mai, Liang Zhao

### 🎯 摘要
Spatial reasoning remains a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle with spatial data retrieval and reasoning. We propose Spatial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Spatial-RAG), a framework that extends RAG to spatial tasks by integrating sparse spatial retrieval (spatial databases) and dense semantic retrieval (LLM-based similarity). A multi-objective ranking strategy balances spatial constraints and semantic relevance, while an LLM-guided generator ensures coherent responses. ...

### 🎯 摘要
In order to thrive in hostile and ever-changing natural environments, mammalian brains evolved to store large amounts of knowledge about the world and continually integrate new information while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Despite the impressive accomplishments, large language models (LLMs), even with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), still struggle to efficiently and effectively integrate a large amount of new experiences after pre-training. In this work, we introduce HippoRAG, a nove...

**作者**: Zhuowan Li, Cheng Li, Mingyang Zhang, Qiaozhu Mei, Michael Bendersky

### 🎯 摘要
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been a powerful tool for Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently process overly lengthy contexts. However, recent LLMs like Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4 show exceptional capabilities to understand long contexts directly. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. We benchmark RAG and LC across various public datasets using three latest LLMs. Results reveal that when resourced suffici...

**作者**: Shi-Qi Yan, Jia-Chen Gu, Yun Zhu, Zhen-Hua Ling

### 🎯 摘要
Large language models (LLMs) inevitably exhibit hallucinations since the accuracy of generated texts cannot be secured solely by the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a practicable complement to LLMs, it relies heavily on the relevance of retrieved documents, raising concerns about how the model behaves if retrieval goes wrong. To this end, we propose the Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG) to improve the robustness of generation...

### 🎯 摘要
Retrieval-augmented in-context learning has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing knowledge-intensive tasks using frozen language models (LM) and retrieval models (RM). Existing work has combined these in simple "retrieve-then-read" pipelines in which the RM retrieves passages that are inserted into the LM prompt. To begin to fully realize the potential of frozen LMs and RMs, we propose Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP), a framework that relies on passing natural language texts in sophist...

### 🎯 摘要
Large language models augmented with task-relevant documents have demonstrated impressive performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, regarding how to obtain effective documents, the existing methods are mainly divided into two categories. One is to retrieve from an external knowledge base, and the other is to utilize large language models to generate documents. We propose an iterative retrieval-generation collaborative framework. It is not only able to leverage both parametric and non-pa...

### 🎯 摘要
Open-domain question answering (QA) systems are often built with retrieval modules. However, retrieving passages from a given source is known to suffer from insufficient knowledge coverage. Alternatively, prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate contextual passages based on their parametric knowledge has been shown to improve QA performance. Yet, LLMs tend to "hallucinate" content that conflicts with the retrieved knowledge. Based on the intuition that answers supported by both sources...

### 🎯 摘要
Despite their remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, di...

### 🎯 摘要
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an effective technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to utilize external knowledge sources for generation. However, current RAG systems are solely based on text, rendering it impossible to utilize vision information like layout and images that play crucial roles in real-world multi-modality documents. In this paper, we introduce VisRAG, which tackles this issue by establishing a vision-language model (VLM)-based RAG pipeline. In this pipeline, ...

Given a graph with textual attributes, we enable users to `chat with their graph': that is, to ask questions about the graph using a conversational interface. In response to a user's questions, our method provides textual replies and highlights the relevant parts of the graph.
