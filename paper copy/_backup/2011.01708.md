## Abstract

We consider a social-type network of coupled phase oscillators. Such a network consists of an

active core of mutually interacting elements, and of a flock of passive units, which follow the driving

from the active elements, but otherwise are not interacting. We consider a ring geometry with a

long-range coupling, where active oscillators form a fluctuating chimera pattern. We show that

the passive elements are strongly correlated. This is explained by negative transversal Lyapunov

exponents.

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

Since their discovery about 20 years ago by Kuramoto and Battogtokh [1], chimera pat
terns attracted large interest in studies of complex systems. Chimera is an example of a

symmetry breaking in a homogeneous system of coupled oscillators: together with a homo
geneous fully synchronous state there exist non-homogeneous states where some oscillators

are synchronized and some not. In spatially extended systems chimera appears as a localized

pattern of asynchrony [2–12]. In globally coupled populations chimeras are also possible:

they emerge not as spatial patterns, rather a group of asynchronous oscillators “detaches”

from the synchronous cluster [13–17].

The basic model of Kuramoto and Battogtokh is a one-dimensional ring of phase os
cillators with non-local coupling. Each oscillator is coupled to all others in a symmetric

bidirectional way; the strength of coupling depends on the distance on the ring. There are

two typical setups for this distance dependence: exponential as in [1] (or its modification

taking into account spatial periodicity [10]), or _cos_ -shape coupling [2]. In both cases, chimera

lives on a symmetric weighted bidirectional network. This paper aims to generalize the basic

setting of the Kuramoto and Battogtokh to a _social-type network_ (STN). Such a network,

introduced in [18], deserves a detailed description. It is a weighted directional network with

two types of nodes: (i) active nodes that force other nodes and potentially are also forced

by them (i.e., active nodes have outgoing links); (ii) passive nodes that are driven by active

nodes but do not influence them (i.e., passive nodes have only in-going links). We illustrate

this in Fig. 1. The name “social-type” is picked because separation into active and passive

nodes is similar to the separation of social networks into “influencers” and “followers”. The

latter participants get input from the former ones, but not vice versa. In physics, there

are several prominent models of such type. In a restricted many-body problem in celes
tial mechanics, one considers several heavy bodies that interact and move according to the

gravitational forces they produce. Additionally, light bodies move in the gravitational field

created by the heavy ones but do not produce gravitational forces themselves (in fact, these

forces are neglected in this setup). Another situation is modeling of two-dimensional tur
bulence by a motion of point vortices [19]. The vortices move as interacting fluid particles,

while other particles, like passive tracers, follow the velocity field created by vortices but do

not contribute to it.

FIG. 1. Illustration of a social-type network. Central blue units are active, they interact with each

other, but do not get inputs from passive units (peripherial red ones). The passive units are driven

by the active ones, and do not interact with each other.

Below we construct the STN by taking a symmetric Kuramoto-Battogtokh network, and

equipping it with additional passive oscillators. We will mainly consider a situation where

the number of passive units is much larger that the number of active ones. The model will

be introduced in Section II. In Section III we will illustrate the dynamics of passive units,

and in Section IV will perform its statistical evaluation.

**II.** **BASIC MODEL**

We consider a network consisting of _N_ active phase oscillators _ϕ_ _n_ and _M_ passive phase

oscillators _ϑ_ _m_ . Both are uniformly distributed in space on a ring [0 _,_ 1), the coordinates

of active units are _x_ _n_ = ( _n −_ 1) _/N_, _n_ = 1 _, . . ., N_ ; the coordinates of passive units are

_y_ _m_ = ( _m −_ 1) _/M_, _m_ = 1 _, . . ., M_ . All oscillators have identical frequency (which we set to

zero chosing the appropriate rotating reference frame), and are nonlocally coupled:


˙
_ϕ_ _n_ = [1]

_N_


˙
_ϑ_ _m_ = _N_ [1]


_N_
� _G_ ( _x_ _k_ _−_ _x_ _n_ ) sin( _ϕ_ _k_ _−_ _ϕ_ _n_ _−_ _α_ ) _,_ _n_ = 1 _, . . ., N,_ (1)

_k_ =1

_N_
� _G_ ( _x_ _k_ _−_ _y_ _m_ ) sin( _ϕ_ _k_ _−_ _ϑ_ _m_ _−_ _α_ ) _,_ _m_ = 1 _, . . ., M ._ (2)

_k_ =1


One can see that this coupling implements an STN: while active oscillators are mutually

coupled, passive ones just follow the force from the active ones.

In previous literature, several coupling kernels _G_ ( _·_ ) has been explored. Kuramoto and

Battogtokh [1] used an exponential kernel, Abrams and Strogatz [2] used a cos-shaped one.

3

We will follow the latter option, and set _G_ as

_G_ ( _x_ ) = 1 + _A_ cos(2 _πx_ ) _._ (3)

Parameters _A_ = 3 _/_ 4 and _α_ = _π/_ 2 _−_ 0 _._ 05 are fixed throughout the paper.

Nontrivial properties in the social-type network (1),(2) can be expected if the number

of active oscillators _N_ is not too large. Indeed, in the thermodynamic limit _N →∞_ the

field created by active oscillators is stationary (in a certain rotating reference frame), and

the dynamics of passive oscillators in this field is trivial. In contradistinction, for relatively

small _N_ there are significant finite-size fluctuations, which, as we will see, lead to nontrivial

effects. On the other hand, it is known that chimera in a very small population is a transient

state [20]. Below in this paper we choose _N_ = 32; for the parameters chosen chimera in

Eqs. (1) is strongly fluctuating and has a long life time.

**III.** **VISUALIZATION OF CHIMERA**

In Fig. 2 we illustrate the chimera state in the set of active units _ϕ_ _k_ . We show the distance

between the states of neighboring active oscillators _D_ _k_ = _|_ sin( _[ϕ]_ _[k]_ [+][1] 2 _[−][ϕ]_ _[k]_ ) _|_ . This quantity is

close to zero if the phases _ϕ_ _k_ and _ϕ_ _k_ +1 are nearly equal, and is 1 if the phase difference is

_π_ . In Fig. 2 the black region corresponds to a coherent domain of chimera (all the phases

here are nearly equal), and the rest with red/yellow colors is the disordered state.

Next we illustrate what happens to passive oscillators in the regime depicted in Fig. 2.

In Fig. 3 we show a snapshot of the states of active and passive oscillators. It has following

features:

1. First we mention that the passive elements which have exactly the same positions as

the active ones, attain the same state. This is due to the fact that although initial

conditions are different, these pairs are driven by exactly the same field, and the

conditional Lyapunov exponents are negative (see a detailed discussion of Lyapunov

exponents below), so that active and passive oscillators synchronize.

2. The active oscillators show typical for chimera domains where the phases are nearly

equal (here 0 _._ 18 ≲ _x_ ≲ 0 _._ 4), and another one, where neighboring elements do not have

close phases. In contradistinction, close in space passive oscillators typically have also

experiences a random walk, so that the dynamics on the long time scale is ergodic - each oscillators

participates in synchronous and asynchronous motions.

close values of the phases. Visually this appears as a continuous profile of passive

phases values. Of course, this profile cannot be exactly continuous because of phase

slips, which are also clearly visible in Fig. 3 (e.g., at _x ≈_ 0 _._ 21 and at _x ≈_ 0 _._ 24).

Such a phase slip disappears due to finite spacing between passive elements and the

stabilizing role of the negative Lyapunov exponent. Thus, passive oscillators possess

certain degree of regularity also in the domain where active oscillators are disordered.

**IV.** **STATISTICAL PROPERTIES**

**A.** **Cross-Correlations**

To characterize the level of regularity of passive units, we calculate the cross-correlation

between the phases. Here, as has been shown in Ref. [18], it is important to use a proper

observable. Indeed, because the rotations of passive phases are not free, their distribution is

not uniform – this can be clearly seen in Fig. 3, where the phases in the disordered domain

are concentrated around the value _ϑ ≈_ 2 _._ 5. In Ref. [18], where the Kuramoto model on a

STN was treated, the transformation from the inhomogeneous phase _ϑ_ to a homogeneous

observable _θ_ was performed using the local instantaneous complex order parameter _z_ =

_⟨e_ _[iϑ]_ _⟩_ _loc_ by virtue of the M¨obius transform

exp[ _iϑ_ ] _−_ _z_
exp[ _iθ_ ] = (4)
1 _−_ _z_ _[∗]_ exp[ _iϑ_ ] _[.]_

In the chimera setup of this paper, we cannot properly define a local complex order parameter

due to strong finite-size fluctuations. Instead, we use transformation (4) with the global order

parameter of active oscillators


_z_ = [1]

After the transformation (4) is performed, the cross-correlation between passive oscillators

is calculated according to

where the averaging is performed over all the pairs of passive phases and over a long time

interval. The latter has been chosen long enough that every oscillator was both in regular

and irregular domains. The correlation function (5) is shown in Fig. 4, for _N_ = 32 and

_M_ = 8192. One can see that the correlation function tends to one as ∆ _y_ = _M_ _[m]_ [tends to zero,]

what corresponds to the mentioned above continuity of the phase profiles. At large ∆ _y_ the

correlations are low; this is the advantage of using the “cleansed” observable _θ_ instead of

the original phase _ϑ_, for the latter the cross-correlations do not drop below 0 _._ 4.

**B.** **Lyapunov exponents**

In the context of STNs, there is a twofold application of the Lyapunov exponents (LEs).

Usual LEs can be defined for a set of active particles, some of them are positive what

corresponds to turbulent dynamics depicted in Fig. 2. For passive oscillators, the LEs have

a meaning of transversal Lyapunov exponents. Indeed, because passive units do not act on

other oscillators, the system (1),(2) is a skew one, and linearization of Eqs. (2) for passive

oscillators leads to a set of independent one-dimensional equations for perturbations

Calculated in this way transversal LEs are shown in Fig. 5. They are all negative, with the

minimum at the central position between the active units.

The interpretation of the transversal LEs is as follows. If there are two passive units at

exactly the same position on the ring but with different initial conditions, then they will

eventually approach each other and synchronize. Quantity _λ_ _t_ gives the average rate of this

exponential approach. In particular, if a passive unit is at the same position as an active

one, they will synchronize with the average rate _λ_ _t_ (0). The result of this synchronization

has been already discussed in Section III.

Negative transversal LEs explain also correlations of neighboring passive units (Fig. 4).

Indeed, neighboring sites (distance ∆ _y_ ) experience different forcing fields, therefore they

cannot synchronize completely. Instead, one can write a model linear equation for the

difference of states of passive units

passive units nearly synchronize for small ∆ _y_ . This picture is however, not exact, as the

discussion in next section shows.

**C.** **Intermittency of satellites**

Here we focus on passive units that are extremely close to the active ones. We call them

“satellites”, and the corresponding active unit the “host”. In the Kuramoto model, such

satellites are perfectly synchronized to the host [18] (similar to the restricted many-body

problem in gravitational dynamics, where light particles in a vicinity of a heavy body do not

leave this vicinity). In the present chimera setup, we however observe a different behavior.

An inspection of Fig. 3 shows that indeed in many cases the satellites are close to the hosts

(these cases a represented by blue “lines” passing through red dots). However, there are

at least three hosts which are detached from the satellites (these are isolated red dots at

_x ≈_ 0 _._ 075 _,_ 0 _._ 74 _,_ 0 _._ 97).

Such a behavior is not covered by the simple relation (8). The reason is in the fluctuations

of the transversal LE, not taken into account in relation (8). Such fluctuations may generally

lead to so-called modulational intermittency [21], and this happens also here. On average

the transversal LE is negative, but the values of quantity (7) averaged over a finite time

interval may be positive. In this case an equation of type (8) results in an amplification of

distances, and the satellites detach from the host. It may take a long transient time until

they attach again. This process is indeed intermittent, as Fig. 6 illustrates. In this figure

we take _L_ = 32 passive satellites _ϑ_ _k_ of an active host, which are spread in the vicinity of

size _−_ 10 _[−]_ [5] _≤_ ∆ _y ≤_ 10 _[−]_ [5] . To characterize these satellites, we calculate their complex order

parameter (using cleansed phases _θ_ )

host _ϕ_ measured as _D_ = _|_ sin [ar][g(] _[z]_ 2 _[s]_ [)] _[−][ϕ]_ _|_ . Most of the time _|z_ _s_ _| ≈_ 1 and _D ≈_ 0, what means

that all the satellites are in a small neighborhood of the host. However, there is a burst

where the satellites spread ( _|z_ _s_ _|_ is as small as 0 _._ 2) and detach from the host. At the final

stage of the burst, the satellites congregate ( _|z_ _s_ _| ≈_ 1), but nevertheless remain remote from

the host ( _D_ is large). This is a quite unusual state, which we attribute to the fact that the

transversal Lyapunov exponent is smaller in absolute value close to the host, as one can see

from Fig. 5. There is quite a long time interval 1300 ≲ _t_ ≲ 1500, where the satellites stay

together but are detached from the host. This observation explains “lonely active units” in

Fig. 3.

**V.** **CONCLUSION**

In this paper we considered a special class of networks - social-type networks STNs.

From the mathematical viewpoint, they are skew systems: one active network with inter
connections, which drives another, passive network. Moreover, we assume that there no

interconnections in the passive subnetwork, so that it consists of individual driven elements.

Furthermore, it is natural to asume that the number of active elements is small, and the

number of passive units is large. This configuration mimics what really is observed in the

social networks like the facebook [22, 23]. We, however, consider the effects related to STN

for oscillatory systems. We have considered both active and passive oscillators forming a

symmetric ring, with long-range interactions. Active oscillators form a chimera pattern,

with a synchronous and an asynchronous domains on a ring. Our main focus was on the

dynamics of passive units. We have demonstrated that they are rather correlated, what is

explained by negative transversal Lyapunov exponents. A remarkable intermittent dynamics

is demonstrated by passive units (satellites) which are very close to an active host. Most

of the time the satellites follow the host, but there are bursts where they detach and leave

the host to move for certain time alone; after that the satellites again attach to the host.

Probably, such a behavior by followers could be observed in social networks as well.

We stress here that essential for our analysis was a rather small number of active oscil
lators. The role of this number is twofold: first, it leads to fluctuations of the force driving

passive elements, and second, it leads to weak turbulence of the active oscillators which

restores ergodicity in the system. Let us briefly discuss, how the effects change for large

active population sizes _N_ . In this case chimera will move so slowly that the time where

ergodicity establishes is not available. Thus, one should distinguish passive oscillators in the

synchronous and the asynchronous domains. Even larger effect on the dynamics of passive

elements is due to smallness of finite-size fluctuations. Indeed, in the thermodynamic limit

_N →∞_ the field acting on oscillators is stationary in the proper rotating reference frame.

Thus, passive elements will have negative LEs in the synchronous domain, and vanishing LEs

in the asynchronous domain. The correlations, which are due to negative LEs, disappear in

this limit, and can be expected to be very weak for large population sizes _N_ .
