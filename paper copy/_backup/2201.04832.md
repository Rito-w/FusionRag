Abstract. We present a general approach to proving the existence of spectral gaps and asynchronous exponential growth for growth-fragmentation semigroups in moment spaces L [1] (R + ; x [α] dx) and L [1] (R + ; (1 + x) [α] dx) for unbounded total fragmentation rates and continuous growth rates r(.) such that
� 0+∞ r(1τ ) [dτ][ = +][∞][.][ The analysis is based on weak compactness tools and]
Frobenius theory of positive operators and holds provided that α > �α for a
suitable threshold �α ≥ 1 that depends on the moment space we consider. A
systematic functional analytic construction is provided. Various examples of
fragmentation kernels illustrating the theory are given and an open problem is
mentioned.

1. Introduction.

1.1. Notation and general assumptions.
This paper deals with the existence of spectral gaps (see (11) below) for C 0 -semigroups (V (t)) t≥0
governing general growth-fragmentation equations

X 0,α := L [1] (R + ; (1 + x) [α] dx), X α := L [1] (R + ; x [α] dx) (α > 0) (2)

with nonnegative total fragmentation rate

a(·) ∈ L [1] loc [(0][,][ +][∞][)]

and a measurable fragmentation kernel b(·, ·) such that b(x, y) = 0 if x ≥ y,

y

xb(x, y)dx = y (3)

� 0

and

the support of (x, +∞) ∋ y → a(y)b(x, y) is unbounded (x > 0) . (4)

This assumption is required for irreducibility of the growth-fragmentation semigroup, which we
also prove under an alternative assumption that a(y) > 0 for y ∈ (0, ∞) and

there is p ∈ [0, 1) such that for any y > 0, inf supp b(·, y) ≤ py. (5)

We note that assumptions (4) and 5 have different physical meaning. If (4) is satisfied, we allow
for particles of some sizes not to fragment. This must be offset, however, by the requirement that
particles of any size can be obtained by fragmentation of arbitrarily large particles. In this way,
non-fragmenting sizes always can be jumped over by daughter particles of parents of a bigger size.
Assumption 5 has different interpretation. The fact that a(y) > 0 means that particles of any size
must split and the second part says that the sizes of daughter particles cannot be too close to the
parent’s size. In physically realistic situations we expect that fragmentation produces at least two
daughter particles whose sizes cannot be both close to the parent’s size and thus in such a case this
assumption is always satisfied. In particular, a common case of the homogeneous fragmentation
kernel b(x, y) = [1] [h] x with h of bounded support, is covered by (5).


b(x, y) = y [1] [h] � xy � with h of bounded support, is covered by (5).

In the case (7), we complement (1) with the boundary condition

y lim →0 [r][(][y][)][u][(][y, t][) = 0][.]

The kinetic equation (1) is the linear part of the growth–coagulation–fragmentation equation
where, in the full form, the coagulation part is represented by a quadratic integral term, see [6].
Coagulation and fragmentation processes lay at heart of many fundamental phenomena in ecology,
human biology, polymer and aerosol sciences, astrophysics and the powder production industry;
see [5] for further details and references, and [11] for the probabilistic context. A common feature of
these processes is that each involves a population of inanimate or animate agents that are capable
of forming larger or smaller aggregates through, respectively, coalescence or breakup. Coagulation
and fragmentation are conservative processes. In many cases, however, they occur alongside other
events that result in the growth of the ensemble. For example, in chemical engineering applications
we often observe a precipitation of matter from the solute onto the surface of the aggregates. In
biological applications, the growth of the aggregates can occur due to births of new individuals with
neonates staying inside the parent’s aggregate, see e.g. [1] for the application to phytoplankton or

[31] in a general context. The interplay of growth and fragmentation plays also an important role
in prion proliferation, see e.g. [18].
In (1), the unknown u(x, t) represents the concentration at time t of “agregates” with mass
x > 0 while b(x, y) (x < y) describes the distribution of mass x aggregates, called daughter aggregates, spawned by the fragmentation of a mass y aggregate. The local mass conservation
in the fragmentation process is expressed by (3); we say that the fragmentation kernel b(·, ·) is

conservative.
In a preliminary step, we provide explicit formulas of the C 0 -semigroups (U (t)) t≥0 (with generator T ) governing the transport equation

∂
∂t [u][(][x, t][) +][ ∂] ∂x [[][r][(][x][)][u][(][x, t][)] +][ a][(][x][)][u][(][x, t][) = 0] (9)

in the functional spaces X = X α or X 0,α and discuss the effect of the conditions on the growth
rate r(·) on them. This direct approach complements a resolvent Hille-Yosida approach [6]; see
also [5] Chapter 5 and [10]. It turns out, at least for bounded total fragmentation rate a(·), that
under Assumption (7), the problem (9) is not well-posed in X α in the sense of C 0 -semigroups;
see Remark 3 below. (This does not prevent a generation theory for suitably singular functions
a(·) but, in this case, the whole construction of the paper would need new technicalities; to keep
the coherence of the paper, this special case is treated separately [28].) Hence, in general, under
Assumption (7), a C 0 -semigroup (U (t)) t≥0 governing (9) is defined only in X 0,α and we restrict our
spectral gap construction to this space. The situation is much more complex under Assumption (8).
Indeed, the problem (9) is well-posed in both X α and X 0,α (with suitable assumptions depending
on the space) but the full spectral gap theory is completed only in X α . Indeed, in X 0,α, although
all the preliminary results we need can be proved, two of them are based on assumptions which
are not compatible: indeed, by using the confining role of singular absorptions [26], the resolvent
compactness of T (which plays a key role in our construction) follows from the unboundedness of
the total fragmentation rate a(·) at infinity and at zero, while the existence of a C 0 -semigroup
(V (t)) t≥0 with generator

T + B : D(T ) → X

(B is the fragmentation operator (10)) depends on the boundedness of a(·) near zero. Hence,
under Assumption (8), we need to restrict our construction to the space X α .
In summary, two spectral gap theories are given in this paper: one in X α under Assumption (8)
and another one in X 0,α under Assumption (7). A spectral gap theory in X α under Assumption
(7) needs additional technicalities and is given in [28]. Finally, the existence of a spectral gap
in X 0,α under (8) is an open problem; see Remark 12. Our main results are given in Theorem
3.8 and Theorem 4.9 and are consequences of many preliminary results of independent interest.
Furthermore, various examples of fragmentation kernels (homogeneous or separable) are given to
illustrate the relevance of our assumptions.
The aim of this paper is twofold. The first aim is well-posedness of (1) in the sense of C 0  semigroups. Indeed, because of the unboundedness of the total fragmentation rate a(·), the fragmentation operator (10) is not a bounded operator on X (where X is either X α or X 0,α ). Under
suitable assumptions, depending on the space we consider, a generation result is obtained by using
a perturbation theorem by W. Desch specific to positive semigroups in L [1] -spaces (see below) where

the perturbation is given by the fragmentation operator


+∞
B : D(T ) ∋ ϕ �→ Bϕ ∈ X, (Bϕ)(x) := a(y)b(x, y)ϕ(y)dy, (10)
� x

and T is the generator of (U (t)) t≥0 in X. The second aim of this work is proving the existence of
a spectral gap of the C 0 -semigroup (V (t)) t≥0 governing (1), i.e., showing that

r ess (V (t)) < r σ (V (t)) (11)

(r ess and r σ are respectively the essential spectral radius and the spectral radius). If, additionally,
(V (t)) t≥0 is irreducible, then, by [29], Corollary 3.16 of Chapter C-III, the spectral bound λ of
its generator is its dominant eigenvalue and a simple pole of the resolvent. Moreover, by [17],
Proposition 3.4 of Chapter VI, λ is a simple eigenvalue, that is, its eigenspace is one-dimensional.
Hence (V (t)) t≥0 has the asynchronous exponential growth property,

−λt
e V (t) − P (12)
��� ��� L(X) [=][ O][(][e] [−][εt] [)]

(for some ε > 0), where P is a one-dimensional spectral projection relative to the isolated algebraically simple dominant eigenvalue λ of the generator, see e.g., [17], Theorem 3.5 of Chapter
VI, defined as P = ⟨e, ·⟩f, where f and e are strictly positive eigenvectors of, respectively, the
generator and its dual, and ⟨·, ·⟩ is the pairing between X and its dual. A summary of these
results can also be found in [34], Appendix C.
The main mathematical ingredients behind the occurrence of the spectral gap are a local
weak compactness property satisfied by general growth-fragmentation equations (due to the onedimensionality of the state variable) and the confining effect of singular total fragmentation rates
ensuring the compactness of the resolvent.
There is an large body of literature dealing with the long term dynamics of solutions to (1) and,
in particular, with the asynchronous exponential growth property and the existence of spectral
gap. The case when the state space is bounded has been well understood since [14], though the
cases with unbounded rates can be tricky, [4]. When the state space is unbounded, a number of
results have been obtained by the powerful General Relative Entropy method introduced in [22].
While the method caters for a large class of coefficients in weighted L [p] spaces, the exponential
rate of convergence has only been established in [32], see also [20], and extensively studied since
then. Due to its physical interpretation it is important to study the problem in L [1] spaces. Some
results have been established by probabilistic methods, see e.g., [11][12] but we are focused on
operator–theoretic results for which we refer to the recent works [23][9][10][13][7]. In particular,
quantitative estimates of the gap are obtained by means of Harris’s theorem, [13], while [7] contains
a comprehensive theory for the discrete case written in the spirit of this paper. A special mention
should be given to [16], where the Perron eigenvector and eigenvalue were found and analysed for
(1) with fairly general coefficients. That paper has stimulated an active research along these lines,
culminating in recent works [9][10].
We note also that most of the known literature on spectral gaps deals with Assumption (7),
see however [13]. Our paper is close in spirit to [10] even if our statements are not the same and
our constructions are different and more systematic; see below.
We note that

+∞ +∞

u(x, t)xdx, u(x, t)dx,

are respectively the total mass and the total number of agregates at time t ≥ 0. The existence of
spectral gaps in the natural functional spaces

X 1 = L [1] (R + ; xdx), X 0 = L [1] (R + ; dx), X 0,1 = L [1] (R + ; (1 + x) dx),

has been dealt with systematically in [27] but at the expense of suitable additional mass loss

or death assumptions. These assumptions seem to be necessary and play a key role in well-posedness
(via W. Desch’s perturbation theorem) of growth-fragmentation equations in these natural spaces.
Fortunately, W. Desch’s theorem can be applied in higher moment spaces without such additional
assumptions (see [6], Theorem 2.2). Actually, we adapt the argument of the proof of ([6], Theorem
2.2) in our construction. This allows for a significant extension of the general theory of [27] to

higher moment spaces (2) by following a similar construction (without resorting to mass loss or
death assumptions) provided that α > �α for a suitable threshold

α� ≥ 1,

depending on the functional space we consider. This is consistent with the existence of thresholds
known in the literature [23][10][13]. As in [27], our analysis is based upon few structural assumptions and provides a systematic functional analytic construction relying on weak compactness tools
and the Frobenius theory of positive operators.
We recall a fundamental perturbation theorem in L [1] spaces, [15] (see also [35], [24] Chapter 8
or [3] Chapter 5).

Theorem 1.1. (W. Desch’s theorem) Let (U (t)) t≥0 be a positive C 0 -semigroup on some L [1] (µ)
space with generator T and let B : D(T ) → L [1] (µ) be positive (i.e. Bϕ ∈ L [1] + [(][µ][)][ if][ ϕ][ ∈] [L] [1] + [(][µ][)][ ∩]
D(T )). Then
T + B : D(T ) → L [1] (µ)

is a generator of a positive C 0 -semigroup on L [1] (µ) if and only if T + B is resolvent positive or,
equivalently, if lim λ→+∞ r σ �B(λ − T ) [−][1] [�] < 1.

1.2. Main results.

1.2.1. Fully singular growth rates (8).
Let us describe first our main results in the spaces X α and X 0,α under Assumption (8).

Properties of the growth–absorption semigroup in X α .
The transport C 0 -semigroup (U (t)) t≥0 governing (9) exists in X α (resp. in X 0,α ) and is given
by

In addition, Assumptions (13) turn out to be also necessary. Note that under (8), the generation
theory in X 0,α needs no condition on the growth rate at the origin. The resolvent of T is given by

If we replace the natural condition sup z>1 r(zz) < +∞ by the stronger one,

then we can show the pointwise estimate in X 0,α,

We show that (λ − T ) [−][1] has a smoothing effect in X α in the sense of improving the integrability
of the input, that is, for λ > α̟,

The above estimates, combined with the general theory, [26], on compactness properties in L [1]

spaces induced by the confining effect of singular absorptions, show that if the sublevel sets of the
total fragmentation rate
Ω c = {x > 0; a(x) < c} (c > 0)


are “thin near zero and near infinity relatively to r” in the sense

where 1 Ω c is the indicator function of Ω c (note that r(1·) [∈][/] [L] [1] [(0][,][ +][∞][)), then][ T][ has a compact]
resolvent in both spaces X α and X 0,α . Note that (17) precludes a(·) to be bounded near zero or
at infinity. Note also that (17) occurs for instance if

lim lim
y→0 [+] [ a][(][y][) = +][∞][,] y→+∞ [a][(][y][) = +][∞][.]

Properties of the full growth–fragmentation semigroup in X α .
In X α, we introduce

y
n α (y) := x [α] b(x, y)dx.
� 0

We note that n 0, abbreviated as

y
n(y) := b(x, y)dx, (18)
� 0

is the mean number (which can be infinite) of daughter aggregates spawned by the fragmentation
of a mass y aggregate.
We show that if


n α (y)

sup < +∞
y>0 y [α]


(note that it is automatically satisfied if α ≥ 1), then the fragmentation operator (10) is T -bounded
in X α and


n α (y)

��B(λ − T ) −1 �� L(X α ) [≤] [lim] a(y sup )→+∞


where


n α (y)

lim sup

n α (y)

y [α]


In particular, by W. Desch’s perturbation theorem (Theorem 1.1),

T + B : D(T ) ⊂ X α → X α

generates a positive C 0 -semigroup (V (t)) t≥0 on X α provided that


lim sup
a(y)→+∞


n α (y)

< 1. (19)
y [α]


In addition

T + B : D(T ) ⊂ X α → X α

is resolvent compact if T is. By exploiting strict comparison results of spectral radii of positive
operators in domination contexts [21] and the convex (weak) compactness property of the strong
operator topology [33][25] (see below), we deduce that (V (t)) t≥0 has a spectral gap (11) and
exhibits the asynchronous exponential growth (12) in X α provided (4) is satisfied (see Theorem
3.8). We conjecture that no spectral gap can occur in X α if a(·) is bounded near zero as suggested
by [10, Theorem 4.1].
One shows the α-monotony


n α ′ (y)


(y > 0) (α [′]   - α)
y [α]


α ′ (y)

≤ [n] [α] [(][y][)]
y [α] [′] y [α]


as well as the α-convexity while, obviously, [n] [1] y [(][y][)] = 1.

It follows that if a(·) is unbounded at infinity then (19) is never satisfied for α ≤ 1. Furthermore,
if


lim sup
y→+∞


n α (y)

< 1 (20)
y [α]

for some α > 1, then it is satisfied for all α > 1 so that if (19) is satisfied in some X α, it is satisfied
in any X α, α > 1. Of course, our construction is meaningful only if (20) holds. This can be directly
checked for instance in the case of homogeneous fragmentation kernels

Analysis in X 0,α — open problems.
The analysis in X 0,α follows the same strategy but the construction fails under Assumption
(8). Indeed, we introduce

y
n 1,α (y) := (1 + x) [α] b(x, y)dx (23)
� 0

and show that if


n 1,α (y)

then the fragmentation operator (10) is T -bounded in X 0,α and

then

A := T + B : D(T ) ⊂ X 0,α → X 0,α (27)

generates a positive C 0 -semigroup (V (t)) t≥0 on X 0,α . Unfortunately, if a(·) is unbounded near

n 1,α (y)

On the other hand, under (8), the compactness of the resolvent of T in X 0,α (which plays a key
role in our construction) depends on the unboundedness of a(·) near zero. This is why, under
Assumption (8), the existence of a spectral gap in X 0,α is an open problem and our construction
is restricted to the space X α .

1.2.2. Partly singular growth rates (7).
Let us describe now our main results under Assumption (7).

Negative results in X α .
We show first, at least for bounded total fragmentation kernels, that (9) is not well-posed in
X α in the sense of C 0 -semigroups and consequently, we cannot expect a generation theory in
X α for the full problem (1) and therefore we restrict ourselves to the space X 0,α . The growth
C 0 -semigroup (U (t)) t≥0 governing (9) with boundary condition

x lim →0 [r][(][x][)][u][(][x, t][) = 0] (28)

sufficient condition is also “partly necessary”.

Properties of the growth–absorbtion semigroup in X 0,α .
We show the estimates (15)(16) in X 0,α . These estimates, combined with the general theory

[26] on compactness properties in L [1] spaces induced by the confining effect of singular absorptions,
show that if the sublevel sets of the total fragmentation rate

Ω c = {x > 0; a(x) < c} (c > 0)

resolvent in X 0,α . This occurs for instance if

lim
y→+∞ [a][(][y][) = +][∞][.]

We introduce (23) and show that under (24) the fragmentation operator is T -bounded in X 0,α
and (27) generates a positive C 0 -semigroup (V (t)) t≥0 on X 0,α provided that (26) is satisfied.

Properties of the full growth–fragmentation semigroup in X 0,α .
By restricting ourselves to the case where a(·) is unbounded at infinity only, (26) amounts to


lim sup
y→+∞


n 1,α (y) (30)
(1 + y) [α] [ <][ 1][.]


Under (30), the generator (27) is resolvent compact in X 0,α if T is. By arguing as previously, we
show that (V (t)) t≥0 has a spectral gap (11) and exhibits the asynchronous exponential growth
(12) in X 0,α provided (4) is satisfied (see Theorem 4.9).
We show the α-monotony


n 1,α� (y)

as well as the α-convexity, and


n 1,1 (y) ≥ 1.

lim sup

This implies that (30) is never satisfied if α ≤ 1. It follows that if


lim sup
α→+∞ [lim] y→+∞

then there exists a unique threshold

such that (30) is satisfied if and only if α > �α. Similarly, our construction is meaningfull only if
(31) holds. To this end, we show that if the growth of (18) at infinity is at most polynomial, i.e.,
if

2. The method of characteristics.
The explicit formulae for solutions to transport equations (9) can be obtained by the method
of characteristics and belong to the mathematical folklore, see e.g., [6, 10]; a systematic treatment
of them can be found [27]. We recall them for the reader’s convenience.

Proposition 1. ([27, Proposition 44]) Let (6) and (7) be satisfied. Then the partial differential
equation
∂
∂t [u][(][x, t][) +][ ∂] ∂x [[][r][(][x][)][u][(][x, t][)] = 0][,][ (][x >][ 0][, t >][ 0)]

with initial and boundary conditions

u(x, 0) = f (x), y lim →0 [r][(][y][)][u][(][y, t][) = 0 (][t >][ 0)]

has a unique solution given by


f (X(y, t)) ∂y [y,t] if � 0y r(1τ ) [dτ > t]

0 if � 0y r(1τ ) [dτ < t]

y 1
� X r(τ ) [dτ]

r(τ ) [dτ][ =][ t,] X(y, t) ∈ (0, y) .


Proposition 2. ([27, Proposition 2]) Let (6) and (8) be satisfied. Then the partial differential
equation
∂
∂t [u][(][x, t][) +][ ∂] ∂x [[][r][(][x][)][u][(][x, t][)] = 0][,][ (][x >][ 0][, t >][ 0)]

with initial condition u(x, 0) = f (x) has a unique solution given by


u(y, t) = [r][(][X][(][y, t][))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))],

where X(y, t) (t > 0) is defined by
� Xy(y,t)

3. First construction.
The first construction is based on Assumption (7). It is devoted to asynchronous exponential
growth in the space X 0,α only since we cannot expect in general a generation theory in X α under
(7), see Remark 1 below.

3.1. Generation theory.
Our first result on the generation of transport semigroups in X 0,α is:

[̸]

and

[̸]

is locally bounded. In this case

[̸]


∥U 0 (t)∥ L(X 0,α ) = sup x>0

This occurs if there exists C > 0 such that

[̸]


(1 + y(x, t)) [α]

(1 + x) [α]

[̸]


r(z) ≤ C(z + 1) (∀z > 0). (34)

In this case, ∥U 0 (t)∥ L(X 0,α ) ≤ e [αCt] .

[̸]


Proof. Let us check that U 0 (t) is a bounded operator on X 0,α . Let y 0 (t) > 0 be defined by

y 0 (t) 1
� 0 r(τ ) [dτ][ =][ t.]

[̸]

(36)
r(τ ) [dτ][ =][ t,]

[̸]


which shows that (for t > 0 fixed) X(y, t) is strictly increasing in y and tends to 0 as y → y 0 (t).
Note that

(y 0 (t), +∞) ∋ y �→ X(y, t) ∈ (0, +∞)

is continuous. Note also that (for t > 0 fixed)

[̸]

is of class C [1] in (y, z) with

∂z r(z) [̸][= 0][,]

so that the implicit function theorem shows that X(y, t) is a C [1] function in y ∈ (y 0 (t), +∞).
Thus, differentiating (36) with respect to y we obtain

1 1 ∂X(y, t)

= 0

r(y) [−] r(X(y, t)) ∂y

so
1 1 ∂X(y, t)

and

(U 0 (t)f ) (y) = f (X(y, t)) [∂X][(][y, t][)] ; y ∈ (y 0 (t), +∞).

The change of variable x = X(y, t) gives

+∞
∥U 0 (t)f ∥ X 0,α = � 0 |f (x)| (1 + y(x, t)) [α] dx,

where y(x, t) is the unique y > x such that x = X(y, t) i.e. (33). Hence


+∞
∥U 0 (t)f ∥ X 0,α = � 0


(1 + y(x, t)) [α]

(1 + x) [α]


and U 0 (t) is a bounded linear operator in X 0,α if and only if


sup
x>0


(1 + y(x, t)) [α]

< +∞.
(1 + x) [α]


In such a case,


∥U 0 (t)∥ L(X 0,α ) = sup x>0


(1 + y(x, t)) [α]

.
(1 + x) [α]


Moreover,

[0, +∞) ∋ t �→ U 0 (t) ∈L(X 0,α )

is locally bounded if and only if



[0, +∞) ∋ t �→ sup
x>0


(1 + y(x, t)) [α]

(1 + x) [α]


is. Using the flow property of (y, t) �→ X(y, t), which follows since it is the solution of an autonomous differential equation, we can prove that the semigroup property U 0 (s)U 0 (t) = U 0 (t +
s), t, s ≥ 0, is satisfied. It is also easy to see that [0, +∞) ∋ t �→ U 0 (t) ∈L(X 0,α ) is locally
bounded. Then, by [17, Proposition I.1.3], to prove that it is a strongly continuous semigroup on
X 0,α, it suffices to check that

U 0 (t)f → f in X 0,α as t → 0

on a dense subspace of L [1] (R + ; (1 + x) [α] dx), e.g. for f continuous with compact support in
(0, +∞). Note that for any compact set [�] c, c [−][1] [�]


� 0y


1
r(τ ) [dτ > t]


for t small enough uniformly in y ∈ �c, c [−][1] [�] so

(U 0 (t)f ) (y) = f (X(y, t)) [∂X][(][y, t][)] ∀y ∈ �c, c [−][1] [�]

∂y


for t small enough. In particular
� Xy(y,t)

and


1
r(τ ) [dτ][ =][ t] ∀y ∈ [�] c, c [−][1] [�]


(U 0 (t)f ) (y) = [r][(][X][(][y, t][))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))] ∀y ∈ [�] c, c [−][1] [�],

r(y)


for t small enough. We note that X(y, t) → y as t → 0 for any y > 0 and uniformly in y ∈ [�] 2 [c] [,][ 2][c] [−][1] [�][.]

Hence


(U 0 (t)f ) (y) = [r][(][X][(][y, t][))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))] → f (y) (t → 0)

r(y)


and, by the dominated convergence theorem, U 0 (t)f → f in X 0,α as t → 0.
Let us continue with the prove of the last statement of the theorem. For fixed x > 0, the
differentiation in t of � xy(x,t) r(1τ ) [dτ][ =][ t][ gives]

1 ∂y(x, t)

= 1

r(y(x, t)) ∂t


i.e.
∂y(x, t) = r(y(x, t)) ∀t > 0, with y(x, 0) = x. (37)

where (34) is used in the last step, so

and Gronwall’s lemma gives
y(x, t) + 1 ≤ (x + 1) e [Ct] .

Finally


(1 + y(x, t)) [α]

sup ≤ e [αCt]
x>0 (1 + x) [α]


and ∥U 0 (t)∥ L(X 0,α ) ≤ e [αCt] .

Remark 1. Note that we cannot expect a generation theory in X α . Indeed, U 0 (t) is bounded in
X α if and only only if


sup
x>0


y(x, t)

< +∞,
x


while (33) and (35) show that lim x→0 y(x, t) = y 0 (t) > 0.

Remark 2. Assumption (34) is partly necessary for the generation theory in X 0,α, see Remark
10 below.

To find the formula of the resolvent of the generator, we take the Laplace transform of
(U 0 (t)) t⩾0 . We point out that the Laplace integral with respect to t of a continuous L 1 (R + ; (1 +
x) [α] dx)-valued function t �→ f (·, t) in the Bochner sense is a.e. in x equal to the Lebesgue integral
with respect to t of f treated as a function of two variables (x, t) → f (x, t), see [3, Example 2.23].
Thus, with some change of variables, we have

Theorem 3.2. Let α > 0, (6), (7) and (34) be satisfied. Let T 0 be the generator of (U 0 (t)) t⩾0 .
Then
�(λ − T 0 ) −1 f � (y) = 1 y e − � xy r(λs) [ds] f (x)dx, (f ∈ X 0,α ) (ℜλ > s(T 0 ))
r(y) � 0

where s(T 0 ) is the spectral bound of T 0 .

We note that the last statement follows due to the positivity of (U 0 (t)) t⩾0, see [30, Theorem
1.4.1].

3.2. A pointwise estimate.
Hereafter we assume that (34) is satisfied.
We give the first key a priori estimate.

Lemma 3.3. Let α > 0, (6), (7) and (34) be satisfied and λ ≥ αC. Then
��(λ − T 0 ) −1 f �� (y) ≤ (1 + y1) [α] r(y) [∥][f] [∥] [X] [0][,α] (f ∈ X 0,α ).

3.3. The first perturbed semigroup.
We build now a second explicit perturbed C 0 -semigroup by solving, using the method of characteristics,
∂
∂t [u][(][x, t][) +][ ∂] ∂x [[][r][(][x][)][u][(][x, t][)] +][ a][(][x][)][u][(][x, t][) = 0]

with initial and boundary conditions

u(x, 0) = f (x), lim x→0 [r][(][x][)][u][(][x, t][) = 0][.]

The solution is given by

− y a(p)
χ [��] y 1 e � X(y,t) r(p) [dp] [ r][(][X][(][y, t][))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))] .
0 r(τ ) [dτ>t] � r(y)

This defines a perturbed C 0 -semigroup (U (t)) t≥0 on X 0,α, dominated by (U 0 (t)) t≥0,


− y a(p)
(U (t)f ) (y) = χ [��] y 1 e � X(y,t) r(p) [dp] [ r][(][X][(][y, t][))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))] . (39)
0 r(τ ) [dτ>t] � r(y)

Remark 3. We have seen in Remark 1 that for a(·) = 0 we cannot expect a generation theory in
X α . Hence, by the bounded perturbation theory, we cannot expect a generation theory in X α for
bounded a(·). But this does not prevent (39) from defining a C 0 -semigroup in X α for a suitably
singular a(·). Actually, this is the case if a(·) is sufficiently singular at zero but then the whole
construction of the paper needs additional tehnicalities. For the sake of clarity, this special case is
treated separately [28].

As previously, the Laplace transform of (U (t)) t⩾0 and some change of variables give:

Proposition 3. Let α > 0 and let (6), (7) and (34) be satisfied. Then, the resolvent of its
generator T is given by
�(λ − T ) [−][1] f � (y) = r(1y) � 0y e − � xy λ+r(aτ()τ ) dτ f (x)dx, (f ∈ X 0,α ) (ℜλ > s(T )).

As in Theorem 3.2, the estimate of the abscissa of convergence of the Laplace integral follows
from the positivity of (U (t)) t⩾0 .

3.4. A smoothing effect of the perturbed resolvent.
The second key a priori estimate is given by:

then

Finally, if (40) is satisfied, L < 1 and then the generation follows from the Desch theorem, Theorem

so (40) is not satisfied. Hence Theorem 3.5 is meaningful if a(·) is unbounded only at infinity; see

Note the useful observation:

Proposition 4. Let (0, ∞) ∋ x → f (x) ∈ (0, ∞) be a non decreasing function and for some there
are y > 0, α 0 - 0 such that

and the statement follows by multiplying both sides with b(x, y) ≥ 0 and integrating over (0, y)
with respect to x.

Remark 5. Applying Proposition 4 to f (x) = (1 + y) [α] we see that if (40) is satisfied for some
α > 0, then it is satisfied for all �α > α.

Remark 6. Note first that our assumption (40) precludes the case α = 1 if a(·) is unbounded at
infinity. Indeed

and then lim sup a(y)→+∞ n(1+ 1,α y(y)) ≥ 1. It follows from Proposition 4 that


lim sup
a(y)→+∞


n(1 + 1,α ( yy)) [≥] [1 (0][ < α][ ≤] [1)][.] (42)


Hence the necessity of higher moments, i.e., α > 1. More precisely, if


lim sup
α→+∞ [lim] a(y)→+∞


n 1,α (y)
(1 + y) [α] [ <][ 1][,]


then the threshold

α > 1; lim sup

� a(y)→+∞


(43)


is such that (40) holds if and only if α > �α. See Proposition 5 below for more information about
this threshold.

Remark 7. If a(·) is only unbounded at infinity, then (40) amounts to


lim sup n 1,α (y) (44)
y→+∞ (1 + y) [α] [ <][ 1]


and (43) is given by


n 1,α (y)

.

α > 1; lim sup

We end this subsection by an upper estimate of the threshold (43).

Proposition 5. We assume that

Then

In particular, if (45) is satisfied and a(·) is unbounded only at infinity, then �α ≤ η, provided �α is
finite.

Proof. Note first that

To prove the last statement, we apply Proposition 4. If (44) is not satisfied for any α, then �α = ∞.
If (44) is satisfied for α < η, then the statement holds. So, we can assume that (44) is satisfied
for some α 2 - η. Let us take arbitrary α 1 - η and α ∈ (α 1, α 2 ). By the convexity, for any y > 0
we have


n 1,α (y)
(1 + y) [α] [ ≤] (1 + [n] [1][,α] y [1] [(] ) [y] [α] [)] [1] [ +]


n 1,α2 (y) n 1,α1 (y)

(1 + y) [α] [1] α 2 − α 1 (1 + y) [α]


For any ǫ 1 - 0 there is y 1 such that for y > y 1

n 1,α 2 (y) α − α 1
< (1 − ǫ 1 ) [α][ −] [α] [1] .
(1 + y) [α] [2] α 2 − α 1 α 2 − α 1


Next, since [(1+][x] [α] [)] [α][1]


1+x [x] [α] [)] [α][1][1] → 1 as x →∞, for any ǫ 2 - 0 we pick y 2 - y 1 such that [(1+] 1+ [x] x [)] [α][α][1][1]


Next, since 1+x [α][1] → 1 as x →∞, for any ǫ 2 - 0 we pick y 2 - y 1 such that 1+x [α][1] ≤ 1 + ǫ 2

for x ≥ y 2 and, since α 1 - η, for large y and some 1 ≤ η < α [′] < α 1, using (45) and

Thus, for any ǫ 3 we have y 3 - y 2 such that for all y > y 3 we have

α 2 − α 1 α 2 − α 1

Since ǫ 3 and ǫ 1 are independent, taking ǫ 3 = [ǫ] 2( [1] [(] α [α] 2 [−] − [α] α [1] ) [)] [we obtain for the corresponding large][ y][,]

n 1,α (y) α − α 1
(1 + y) [α] [ ≤] [1][ −] [ǫ] 2 [1] α 2 − α 1

hence, since α 1 - η is arbitrary, we have �α ≤ η.

Remark 8. Similar estimates appear in [8, Theorem 2.2] and [6, Theorem 2.2], where W. Desch’s
theorem is used with the weight 1 + x [α] instead of (1 + x) [α] .

3.6. Compactness results.

On the other hand on �0, ε [−][1] [�] we have the uniform domination

��(λ − T ) f �� (y) ≤ (1 + y) [α] r(y) (∥f ∥ X 0,α ≤ 1),

where
1( 0,ε −1 )(y)

(1 + y) [α] r(y) [∈] [X] [0][,α] [.]

Finally �(λ − T ) [−][1] f ; ∥f ∥ X 0,α ≤ 1� is as close to the relatively weakly compact set

�1( 0,ε −1 )(y)(λ − T ) [−][1] f ; ∥f ∥ X 0,α ≤ 1�

as we want and consequently it is weakly compact. This shows that (λ − T ) [−][1] is weakly compact
operator and consequently (see [26, Lemma 14]) (λ − T ) [−][1] is compact.

Corollary 1. Let (6), (7), (34) and (40) be satisfied and let the sublevel sets of a(·) be thin at
infinity in the sense of (46). Then A := T + B : D(T ) → X 0,α, where B is defined by (10), is
resolvent compact.

Proof. This follows simply from Theorem 3.6 and the fact that for λ large enough, [�] [+] n=0 [∞] �B(λ − T ) [−][1] [�] [n]

is a bounded operator and

3.7. Spectral gap of (V (t)) t⩾0 in X 0,α .
We start with an irreducibility result which extends [5, Theorem 5.2.21] and is based on ideas
from [7, Proposition 2].

Theorem 3.7. Let α > 0, (6), (7), (34) and (40) and either

1. for any x > 0, supp 0≤y≤+∞ a(y)b(x, y) is unbounded, or
2. a(y) > 0 for a.a. y > 0 and there is 0 ≤ p < 1 such that for each y > 0, inf supp b(·, y) ≤ py

be satisfied. Then (λ − T − B) [−][1] is positivity improving, i.e.,

(λ − T − B) [−][1] g > 0 a.e.

for any nontrivial nonnegative g ∈ X 0,α or, equivalently, the C 0 -semigroup (V (t)) t≥0 is irreducible
in X 0,α .

Let g > 0 and set z g = sup{z : g(z) = 0 a.a. on [0, z]}. If z g = 0, then obviously (λ − T ) [−][1] g > 0.
and the result is valid. Assume then that z g - 0 and observe that

and [(λ − T ) [−][1] g](z) is positive for x > z g . Then, for x < z g,

hence Ψ 1 (x) := [(λ − T ) [−][1] B(λ − T ) [−][1] g](x) > 0 for any x > 0. Otherwise, on using assumption
2, Ψ 1 (x) > 0 for x > inf supp b(·, z g ). Thus, if p = 0 (in particular, if b(x, y) > 0 for all y > 0 and
0 < x < y), then the result is proved. If p > 0, then Ψ 1 (x) > 0 at least for x > pz g . Next, the
third term of (47) is given by

Ψ 2 (x) := [(λ − T ) [−][1] (B(λ − T ) [−][1] ) [2] f ](x) = [(λ − T ) [−][1] BΨ 1 ](x)

and thus, by the same argument, Ψ 2 (x) > 0 for x > p [2] z g . Using induction and p [n] → 0, we
conclude that [(λ − T − B) [−][1] f ](x) > 0 almost everywhere.

Corollary 2. Assumption 2. of Theorem 3.7 are satisfied if either

: (i) there is δ > 0 such that for any y > 0 we have n 0 (y) ≥ 1 + δ, or
: (ii) b ∈ L ∞,loc (R + × R + ).

Proof. Assume that (i) is satisfied. If inf supp b(·, y) = 0, then we are done. Otherwise, let for
some y, inf supp b(·, y) = p [′] y for some p [′] ∈ (0, 1); p [′] can depend on y. Then


p [′] [,]


y 1
1 + δ ≤ n 0 (y) = b(x, y)dx ≤
� p [′] y p [′] y


� y [′]


y

xb(x, y)dx = [1]
p [′] y p


which implies p [′] ≤ (1+ δ) [−][1] . Hence, if we select p (independent of y) such that (1+ δ) [−][1] < p < 1,
then for each y > 0, inf supp b(·, y) ≤ (1 + δ) [−][1] y < py. If, instead of (i), assumption (ii) is
satisfied, then the constant p of the proof of Theorem 3.7 may be y dependent and though in
each step we can prove that the positivity of Ψ n on [z n, ∞) implies the positivity of Ψ n+1 on

[z n+1, ∞), where z n+1 = p(z n )z n, z 1 = z g, this sequence may converge (as a decreasing sequence)
to a z ∞ - 0. Then, however, we would have

supp b(·, z n ) ⊂ (z ∞, z n ], n ∈ N;

that is,

z n
z n = xb(x, z n )dx.
� z ∞

This, however, leads to a contradiction, since the left-hand side converges to z ∞ - 0 and the
right-hand side, by (ii), to 0.

We are ready to show the main result of the first construction.

Theorem 3.8. Under assumptions of Theorem 3.7, let the sublevel sets of a(·) be thin at infinity
in the sense of (46). Then (V (t)) t≥0 has a spectral gap, i.e.,

r ess (V (t)) < r σ (V (t)),

and it has the asynchronous exponential growth property (12) in X 0,α .

Proof. Let
k(x, y) := 1 {x<y} a(y)b(x, y)

be the kernel of B. Let further

k(x, y) := k(x, y) ∧ 1

and

k c (x, y) := k(x, y)p(x)p(y),
where p ∈ C(0, +∞) has a compact support in (0, +∞) and 0 ≤ p(x) ≤ 1. Note that

k(x, y) ⩾ k c (x, y)

and

k(x, y) = k(x, y) − k c (x, y) + k c (x, y)
� �

�
= k(x, y) + k c (x, y),

where

�
k(x, y) := k(x, y) − k c (x, y).

�Let B be the integral operator with kernel k c (x, y) and let B [�] be the integral operator with kernel
k(x, y). Since �k(x, y) ≤ k(x, y),

for λ large enough,
����B(λ − T ) [−][1] [��] � L(X 0,α ) [≤] ��B(λ − T ) −1 �� L(X 0,α ) [<][ 1][,]

so T +B [�] : D(T ) → X 0,α generates a positive semigroup (V [�] (t)) t⩾0 . Note that (V (t)) t⩾0 is generated
by
T + B [�] + B
� �

where B is a bounded operator on X 0,α . Actually the kernel of B is compactly supported in
(0, +∞) × (0, +∞) and bounded and consequently B is a weakly compact operator on X 0,α . On
the other hand

V (t) = V [�] (t) + t V� (t − s)B �V (s)ds
� 0

and [�] 0 [t] [V][�][ (][t][ −] [s][)][B][ �][V][ (][s][)][ds][ is a weakly compact operator (see [][33][] or [][25][]) so that (][V][�][ (][t][))] [t][⩾][0] [ and]
(V (t)) t⩾0 have the same essential spectrum [19] and then the same essential radius

r ess (V [�] (t)) = r ess (V (t)). (48)

On the other hand, V [�] (t) ≤ V (t),

(λ − T − B [�] ) [−][1] ≤ (λ − T − B) [−][1]

and
(λ − T − B [�] ) [−][1] ̸= (λ − T − B) [−][1],

because B ̸= 0. Since, by Theorem 3.7, (λ−T −B) [−][1] is positivity improving (and thus irreducible)
and compact (by Corollary 1),

r σ �(λ − T − B [�] ) [−][1] [�] < r σ �(λ − T − B) [−][1] [�],

see [21]. Next,

1 1
r σ �(λ − T − B [�] ) [−][1] [�] = λ − s(T + B [�] ), r σ �(λ − T − B) [−][1] [�] = λ − s(T + B)

(see [29]) implies
s(T + B [�] ) < s(T + B) (49)

and hence, in particular,
s(T + B) > −∞.
Note that the type of a positive semigroup on L [1] -spaces coincides with the spectral bound of its
generator, see e.g. [36]. We combine this with (49) to get

r ess (V (t)) = r ess (V [�] (t)) ≤ r σ (V [�] (t)) = e [s][(][T][ +][ �] B)t < e s(T +B)t = r σ (V (t))

so r ess (V (t)) < r σ (V (t)). Finally, as explained in Introduction, the irreducibility of (V (t)) t≥0
ensures, by [29, Corollary 3.16 of Chapter C-III], that the dominant eigenvalue is a simple pole

22 MUSTAPHA MOKHTAR-KHARROUBI AND JACEK BANASIAK

and, by [17, Proposition 3.4 of Chapter VI], we see that it is simple, that is, its eigenspace is
one-dimensional.

4. Second construction.
This construction is based on Assumption (8).

4.1. Generation results.

We start with the space X α .

Theorem 4.1. Let α > 0. We assume that (8) is satisfied. Let X(y, t) (t > 0) be defined by
� Xy (y,t) r(1τ ) [dτ][ =][ t.][ Then]


(U 0 (t)f ) (y) := [r][(][X][(][y, t][))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))]


∂y



[))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))] = f (X(y, t)) [∂X][(][y, t][)]

r(y) ∂y


defines a positive C 0 -semigroup (U 0 (t)) t⩾0 on X α if and only if


sup
x>0


y(x, t)

< +∞ (t ⩾ 0)
x


and



[0, +∞) ∋ t → sup
x>0


y(x, t)

is locally bounded
x


where y(x, t) > x is defined by [�] x [y][(][x,t][)] r(1τ ) [dτ][ =][ t.][ In this case,]


∥U 0 (t)∥ L(X α ) = sup x>0


y [α] (x, t)

.
x [α]


This occurs if

in which case ∥U 0 (t)∥ L(X α ) ≤ e [αCt] .

Proof. We set


C := sup
z>0


r(z)

< +∞, (50)
z


U 0 (t)f := [r][(][X][(][y, t][))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))]


r(y)
and argue as in the proof of Theorem 3.1. Let us check that U 0 (t) is a bounded operator on
X α . Note that
y 1

(51)

� X r(τ ) [dτ][ =][ t]


X(y,t)

(51)
r(τ ) [dτ][ =][ t]


and (8) show that (for t > 0 fixed) X(y, t) is strictly increasing in y and

y lim →0 [X][(][y, t][) = 0][,] y→ lim +∞ [X][(][y, t][) = +][∞][.]

Since
1 1 ∂X(y, t)
r(y) [=] r(X(y, t)) ∂y,

we have

(U 0 (t)f ) (y) = f (X(y, t)) [∂X][(][y, t][)], y ∈ (0, +∞)

∂y

and


+∞
∥U 0 (t)f ∥ X α =

y [α] dy.
∂y


+∞

|f (X(y, t))| [∂X][(][y, t][)]

The change of variable x = X(y, t) yields

+∞
∥U 0 (t)f ∥ X α = |f (x)| y [α] (x, t)dx,
� 0

1
where y(x, t) is the unique y > x such that x = X(y, t) i.e., [�] x [y][(][x,t][)] r(τ ) [dτ][ =][ t.][ Since]


+∞
∥U 0 (t)f ∥ X α =
� 0


y [α] (x, t)

|f (x)| x [α] dx,
x [α]


U 0 (t) is a bounded operator on X α if and only if sup x>0 y(x,tx ) < +∞. In this case


y [α] (x, t)

∥U 0 (t)∥ L(X α ) = sup x>0 x [α]

SPECTRAL GAPS OF GROWTH-FRAGMENTATION SEMIGROUPS 23

and

[0, +∞) ∋ t → U 0 (t) ∈L(X α )

is locally bounded if and only if



[0, +∞) ∋ t → sup
x>0


y(x, t)

x


is locally bounded. As in the proof of Theorem 3.1, to show that (U 0 (t)) t⩾0 is strongly continuous
on X α it suffices to check that

U 0 (t)f → f in L [1] (R + ; x [α] dx) as t → 0

on a dense subspace of L [1] (R + ; x [α] dx), e.g. for f continuous with compact support in (0, +∞).
Note that (51) shows that X(y, t) → y as t → 0 uniformly in y in compact sets of (0, +∞). By
arguing as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, one sees that

U 0 (t)f = [r][(][X][(][y, t][))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))] → f (t → 0)

r(y)

in L [1] (R + ; x [α] dx) by the dominated convergence theorem. Finally (37) implies


t t

r(y(x, s))ds ≤ x +
0 � 0


t
y(x, t) = x +
� 0


Cy(x, s)ds (52)
0


so, by Gronwall’s lemma, y(x, t) ≤ xe [Ct] and sup x>0 y [α] x( [α] x,t) ≤ e [αCt] .

Remark 10. One can show (see [27, Proposition 6]) that if


r(z)
lim
z→0 z


= +∞,
z


z) r(z)

= +∞ or lim
z z→+∞ z


then sup x>0 y(x,tx ) = +∞. In particular we have not a generation theory in X α . This shows

the “optimality” of Assumption (50) in X α . This shows also that in Theorem 3.1, (34) is partly

necessary.

We deal now with X 0,α .

Theorem 4.2. Let α > 0. We assume that (8) is satisfied. Let X(y, t) (t > 0) be defined by
� Xy (y,t) r(1τ ) [dτ][ =][ t.][ Then]


(U 0 (t)f ) (y) := [r][(][X][(][y, t][))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))]


∂y



[))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))]

= f (X(y, t)) [∂X][(][y, t][)]
r(y) ∂y


defines a positive C 0 -semigroup (U 0 (t)) t⩾0 on X 0,α if and only if


1 + y(x, t)

sup < +∞ (t ⩾ 0)
x>0 1 + x


and


1 + y(x, t)

[0, +∞) ∋ t → sup is locally bounded,
x>0 1 + x


where y(x, t) ≥ x is defined by � xy(x,t) r(1τ ) [dτ][ =][ t.][ In this case]


∥U 0 (t)∥ L(X 0,α ) = sup x>0


(1 + y(x, t)) [α]

.
(1 + x) [α]


This occurs if


� r(z)
C := sup < +∞. (53)
z>1 z


Proof. Arguing as in the previous proof, we obtain


+∞
∥U 0 (t)f ∥ X 0,α = � 0


(1 + y) [α] dy,
∂y


+∞

|f (X(y, t))| [∂X][(][y, t][)]
0 ∂y


so


+∞
∥U 0 (t)f ∥ X 0,α = � 0 |f (x)| (1 + y(x, t)) [α] dx


+∞

=

(1 + y(x, t)) [α]

|f (x)| (1 + x) [α] dx

24 MUSTAPHA MOKHTAR-KHARROUBI AND JACEK BANASIAK

and


∥U 0 (t)∥ L(X 0,α ) = sup x>0


(1 + y(x, t)) [α]

.
(1 + x) [α]


Note that [�] x [y][(][x,t][)] r(1τ ) [dτ][ =][ t][ implies that lim] [x][→][0] [ y][(][x, t][) = 0 uniformly for bounded sets of][ t][, so,]

for any t > 0,


sup sup
t∈ [ 0,t ] x<1


1 + y(x, t)

< +∞.
(1 + x)


Since

y(x, t) ≥ x and, by (53),

Hence,


t
y(x, t) = x + r(y(x, s))ds,
� 0


t �
y(x, t) ≤ x + Cy(x, s)ds (x > 1).
� 0


t �
1 + y(x, t) ≤ 1 + x + C (1 + y(x, s)) ds (x > 1)
� 0


and

Ct�
1 + y(x, t) ≤ (1 + x) e (x > 1)

by Gronwall’s inequality. Finally,


(1 + y(x, t)) [α]

t → sup < +∞
x>0 (1 + x) [α]


is locally bounded. The rest of the proof is the same as the previous one.

Remark 11. As in Remark 10, if

r(z)
lim = +∞,
z→+∞ z


then sup x>0 y(x,tx ) = +∞. This again shows the “optimality” of Assumption (53) in X 0,α .

4.2. A pointwise estimate.
We give now the first a priori estimate in the spaces X α and X 0,α .

Lemma 4.3. Let α > 0 and let (8) be satisfied.
(i) Let (50) be satisfied and λ ≥ αC. Then

−1 1
��(λ − T 0 ) f �� (y) ≤ y [α] r(y) [∥][f] [∥] [X] [α] (f ∈ X α ).

��(λ − T 0 ) −1 f �� (y) ≤ (1 + y1) [α] r(y) [∥][f] [∥] [X] [0][,α] (f ∈ X 0,α ).

Proof. (i) Note that r(τ ) ≤ Cτ (∀τ > 0), that is,

− y a(p)
e � X(y,t) r(p) [dp] [ r][(][X][(][y, t][))][f] [(][X][(][y, t][))] .

This defines a perturbed C 0 -semigroup (U (t)) t≥0 on both X α and X 0,α, dominated by (U 0 (t)) t≥0,

As previously, the Laplace transform of (U (t)) t⩾0 and some change of variables give:

Proposition 6. Let α > 0, (8) and (50) (resp. (53)) be satisfied. The resolvent of the generator

and hence (58) cannot be satisfied. On the other hand, the compactness result we need in the
sequel demands the unboundedness of a(·) near zero. Hence, under Assumption (8), it is not
possible to finalize our spectral gap construction in the space X 0,α . We point out that even if a(·)
is unbounded near zero, we can still define a positive C 0 -semigroup (V (t)) t≥0 on X 0,α which
solve the growth fragmentation equations but in some generalized sense (honesty theory), where
the domain of the generator T B is the closure of T + B only, see [5, Chapter 5]. However, in this
case, we cannot infer that T B is resolvent compact when T is and the key argument behind the
existence of the spectral gap fails.

If (59) holds for α 2, for any ǫ > 0, there is c ǫ such that n α2 [α] ( [2] y)


If (59) holds for α 2, for any ǫ > 0, there is c ǫ such that α y 2 [α][2] ≤ 1 − ǫ on {y ∈ (0, ∞); a(y) ≥ c ǫ }

and hence on this set

Thus it follows that if (59) holds for some α 2 - 1, then it holds for all α > 1.

4.6. Compactness results.
By using Lemma 4.3, Lemma 4.4 and arguing as in the proof of Theorem 3.6 we get:

Theorem 4.7. Let α > 0, (8) and (50) (resp. (14)) be satisfied. Let the sublevel sets of a(·) be
thin at zero and at infinity in the sense that for any c > 0

+∞ 1
� 0 1 {a<c} r(y) [dy <][ +][∞]

(e.g., let lim x→+∞ a(x) = +∞ and lim x→0 a(x) = +∞). Then T is resolvent compact in X α
(resp. in X 0,α ).

Similarly to Corollary 1 we have

Corollary 3. Let (8), (50) and (59) be satisfied. If the sublevel sets of a(·) are thin at zero and
at infinity (e.g. if lim x→+∞ a(x) = +∞ and lim x→0 a(x) = +∞), then A := T + B is resolvent
compact in X α .

4.7. Spectral gap of (V (t)) t⩾0 in X α .
The same proof as for Theorem 3.7 gives:

Lemma 4.8. Let α > 0 and assumptions 1. or 2. of Theorem 3.7, (8), (50) and (59) be satisfied.
Then (λ − T − B) [−][1] is positivity improving in X α or, equivalently, the C 0 -semigroup (V (t)) t≥0
is irreducible in X α .

Finally, the same proof as for Theorem 3.8 gives the main result of the second construction.

Theorem 4.9. Let α > 0 and assumptions 1. or 2. of Theorem 3.7, (8), (50) and (59) be
satisfied. If the sublevel sets of a(·) are thin at zero and at infinity, (e.g. if lim x→+∞ a(x) = +∞
and lim x→0 a(x) = +∞), then (V (t)) t≥0 has an asynchronous exponential growth in X α .

Remark 14. We conjecture that the result does not hold without the unboundedness of a(·) at
zero as suggested by [10, Theorem 4.1].

Appendix A. Separable fragmentation kernels. We have seen how homogeneous fragmentation kernels satisfy the key assumptions (40) and (59) of our construction. This last section is
devoted to separable fragmentation kernels

b(x, y) = β(x)γ(y),

introduced in [2], see also [3][5]. It is easy to see that separable kernels with mass conservation (3)
are of the form

y −1
b(x, y) = β(x)y sβ(s)ds (61)
�� 0 �

where

y
0 < sβ(s)ds < +∞∀y > 0.
� 0

A particular case of separable kernels are power law kernels

x [ν]
b(x, y) = (ν + 2) (ν ∈ (−2, 0]).

y [ν][+1]

We can complement Theorem 4.6 by:

Proposition 7. We assume that the fragmentation kernel is of the form (61) and a(·) is only
unbounded at zero and infinity. If

β 0 [−] [:= lim inf] x→0 [xβ][(][x][)][ >][ 0][,][ β] 0 [+] [:= lim sup] x→0 xβ(x) < +∞

and
+∞

x [α] β(x)dx < +∞,

� 0

then (59) is satisfied provided α > β 0 [+] .

Remark 15. If β 0 := lim x→0 xβ(x) > 0 exists then β 0 [+] [=][ β] 0 [−] [and both (][62][) and (][63][) are satisfied]
for any α > 1 such that [�] 0 [+][∞] x [α] β(x)dx < +∞.

Similarly, we can complement Theorem 3.5 by:

Proposition 8. We assume that the fragmentation kernel is of the form (61) and a(·) is only
unbounded at infinity. If
+∞

β(x) 1 + x [α] [�] dx < +∞ (64)

� 0 �

for some α > 1 then (40) is satisfied for any α > 1 and consequently the threshold is equal to one.


Note first that


y −1 y

y
n 1,α (y) := y

β(x) (1 + x) [α] dx

and hence (40) amounts to


� 0y [β] � [(] 0 [x] y [) (1 +][xβ][(][x][)][ x][dx][)] [α] [ dx] < 1.


lim sup
y→+∞


y
(1 + y) [α]


Note that (64) implies that

+∞

β(x) (1 + x [α] ) dx < +∞ (0 < α ≤ α).

� 0


It is easy to see that (1 + x) [α] ≤ 2 [α][−][1] (1 + x [α] ) so

y

β(x) (1 + x) [α] dx ≤ 2

� 0


β(x) (1 + x [α] ) dx

and consequently, for any 1 < α ≤ α,

� 0 [xβ][(][x][)][dx] y [α][−][1] � 0 [xβ][(][x][)][dx]

and this ends the proof.

Remark 16. We note that any convex combination of conservative fragmentation kernels is a
conservative fragmentation kernel so

(J finite or denumerable) is a conservative kernel and we can check the key conditions lim sup a(y)→+∞ n α y [α] (y) <

1 or lim sup a(y)→+∞ n(1+ 1,α y()y [α] ) [ <][ 1 more generally for (][65][) by using just the last two propositions]
above. We could also consider convex combinations of separable kernels and homogeneous ones.
