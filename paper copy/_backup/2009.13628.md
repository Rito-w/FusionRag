Abstract

We obtain a sharp estimate of the speed of convergence in the Boolean central limit theorem for measures of finite sixth moment. The main tool is a
quantitative version of the Stieltjes-Perron inversion formula.

Keywords: Stieltjes-Perron formula, L´evy distance, Boolean Central limit
theorem, Berry-Esseen theorem.

1. Introduction


In the previous work [1] of Arizmendi and the author, we proved that
the speed of convergence in the Boolean central limit theorem is of order
O( √ [1] n ) for measures with bounded support and of order O( [√] 3 [1] n [) for measures]

with finite fourth moment. Also in [1] an example is given, consisting on an
atomic measure with exactly two atoms, that shows that the rate √1n can not
be improved. Thus, the estimate of the speed of convergence for measures of
bounded support is sharp.
In this paper we obtain an improvement of the above results by showing that the speed of convergence in the Boolean central limit theorem for
measures of finite sixth moment is of order O( √ [1] n ), and thus by the example
mentioned above, this estimate is sharp.

where b denotes the symmetric Bernoulli distribution, 2 [δ] [−][1] [ +] [ 1] 2 [δ] [1] [,][ and][ C][ is]

a constant that depends only on µ.


The proof of this theorem relies on refinements of some estimates related
to the Cauchy transform of a measure. These precise estimates are given
in Theorem 2, which provides a quantitative version of the Stieltjes-Perron
inversion formula. Also in Proposition 2 we show an asymptotic upper bound
for the Cauchy transform of a measure in terms of its moments.
The sections are organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the preliminary material and technical results necessary to prove our main result.
Particularly, in Section 2.2, we present Theorem 2 and discuss some interesting consequences. In Section 3, we prove Theorems 1 and 2.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. The L´evy distance

Let µ and ν probability measures. We define the L´evy distance between
them to be

d lev (µ, ν) := inf {ǫ > 0 | F (x − ǫ) − ǫ ≤ G(x) ≤ F (x + ǫ) + ǫ for all x ∈ R},

where F and G are the cumulative distribution functions of µ and ν respectively.
The following Proposition is the Lemma 2 in [1], and it is a key ingredient
in the proof of Theorem 1.

Proposition 1. Let µ be a probability measure of zero mean and unit variance. Suppose further that µ((−1 − ǫ, −1 + ǫ) ∪ (1 − ǫ, 1 + ǫ)) ≥ 1 − ǫ for
some ǫ ∈ (0, 1). Then

d lev (µ, b) ≤ [7]

2 [ǫ.]

2.2. The Cauchy Transform

Throughout the paper z denotes a complex number and we write z =
x + iy, where x and y are real numbers.
The Cauchy transform (or Stieltjes transform) of a non-negative Borel
measure µ is defined as


G µ (z) :=
� R


1
for z ∈ C [+],
z − t [dµ][(][t][)]


where C [+] denotes the open upper complex half-plane.
We can recover a measure µ ∈M from its Cauchy transform via the
Stieltjes-Perron inversion formula:


µ([a, b]) = lim
y↓0 [−] π [1]


b

Im(G µ (x + iy))dx,

� a


provided that µ({a, b}) = 0.
The following theorem is a quantitative version of the Stieltjes-Perron
inversion formula which is tailored for our purposes. This will be proved in
Section 3.1.

Theorem 2. Let µ be a probability measure. Let −∞≤ a < b ≤∞. Then
we have that for all y > 0

Note that if δ = [√] y and y ↓ 0, then we obtain the Stieltjes-Perron
inversion formula for probability measures. Moreover, taking a = −∞ and

µ [y] = µ ∗ C y where C y is the Cauchy distribution with location 0 and scale y.
This further implies the following inequality for the L´evy distance between
two probability measures in terms of the Cauchy transform

Next, we discuss some bounds for the Cauchy transform.
Since |z − t| ≥ y for all t ∈ R, then it follows that

|G µ (z)| ≤ [µ][(][R][)] for z ∈ C [+] . (1)

y

The following proposition gives another bound for |G µ (z)|, where instead
we use the real part of z. In practice, this is very useful since x is typically
much larger than y.

Proposition 2. Let µ be a measure and i ≥ 0. Then we have that

|G µ (z)| < [2][µ][(][R][)]

|G µ (z)| < [2][µ][(][R][)] + [4] . (2)

The reciprocal Cauchy transform (or F -transform) of a positive Borel
measure µ ∈M is defined as

1
F µ (z) := for z ∈ C [+] .
G µ (z)

Directly by definition, it is not too difficult to see that for a probability
measure µ and a > 0, then

F D a µ (z) = aF µ (z/a) for z ∈ C [+], (3)

4

where D a µ denotes the dilation of a measure µ by a factor a > 0; this means
that D a µ(B) = µ(a [−][1] B) for all Borel sets B ⊂ R.
The next proposition gives a fundamental representation of the F -transform
for the probability measures that are of our interest.

Proposition 3. Let µ a probability measure such that m 1 (µ) = 0, m 2 (µ) = 1,
and m 6 (µ) < ∞. Then there exists a real number α and a non-negative Borel
measure ω such that m 2 (ω) < ∞ and

1
F µ (z) = z − for z ∈ C [+] .
z − α − G ω (z)

Proof. Let µ as in the hypothesis. Since m 1 (µ) = 0 and m 2 (µ) = 1, then by
Proposition 2.1 in [3] we have that there exists a probability measure ν such
that
F µ (z) = z − G ν (z) for z ∈ C [+] .

Moreover, since m 6 (µ) < ∞, then by Proposition 4.8 also in [3] we have
that m 4 (ν) < ∞. Again by the same propositions aplied to ν, we get that
there exists a real number α and non-negative measure ω such that m 2 (ω) <
∞ and
F ν (z) = z − α − G ω (z) for z ∈ C [+] .

The desired representation follows from the above equations.

Remark 1. It can be shown that α = m 3 (µ) and ω(R) = m 4 (µ) − m 3 (µ) [2] − 1
by using in the previous proof that G ν (z) = z − F µ (z) is the K-transform of
µ, see [2], and then expressing the first moments of ν in terms of the Boolean
cumulants of µ, see [1], which in turn would be in terms of the first moments
of µ.

2.3. Boolean convolution

Given probability measures µ and ν, the Boolean convolution µ ⊎ ν, introduced by Speicher and Woroudi [2], is the probability measure defined by
the equation

F µ⊎ν (z) = F µ (z) + F ν (z) − z for z ∈ C [+] .

Let µ be a probability measure and n be a positive integer. We want to
obtain an expression for the F-transform of µ n := D 1
√n [(][µ] [⊎][n] [).]

5

First note that

F µ ⊎n (z) = (1 − n)z + nF µ (z) for z ∈ C [+] .

Now, suppose further that m 1 (µ) = 0, m 2 (µ) = 1, and m 6 (µ) < ∞. Thus,
by Proposition 3 we get that

n
F µ ⊎n (z) = z − for z ∈ C [+],
z − α − G ω (z)

where α is a real number and and ω is a non-negative Borel measure such
that � t [2] dω(t) < ∞. Finally, applying (3) we obtain the representation

1
F µ n (z) = z − α 1 for z ∈ C [+] . (4)
z − √n − √n G ω ( [√] nz)

3.2. Proof of Theorem 1

Fix a probability measure µ such that m 1 (µ) = 0, m 2 (µ) = 1, and
m 6 (µ) < ∞. Define µ n := D 1
√n [(][µ] [⊎][n] [). We begin by obtaining some rep-]
resentations for the imaginary part of the Cauchy transform of µ n .
Note that

− Im(G µ n (z)) = [Im] |F [(] µ [F] n [µ] ( [n] z [(] ) [Z] | [2] [))] . (5)

Recall that by (4) we have the representation

1
F µ n (z) = z − α 1 for z ∈ C [+],
z − √n − √n G ω ( [√] nz)

where α is a real number and ω is a non-negative Borel measure such that
� t [2] dω(t) < ∞. Define W n (z) = z − √αn − √1n G ω ( [√] nz) so that F µ n (z) =
1
z −
W n (Z) [. It follows that]

− ImG µ n (z) = [y][|][W] [n] [(][z][)][|] [2] [ +][ Im][(][W] [n] [(][z][))] . (6)

|zW n (z) − 1| [2]

Next, we establish two lemmas that carry the main estimations of the
proof. But first, we define some constants and give an inequality that is vital

for making such estimations. Let K = max{ω(R), � t [2] dω(t)}. Now, take
C > max{5, |α| + 2, 4(K + 1) [2], 1 + 0.13 [2] [(30][K][ + 1)][}][, let][ n >][ max][{][20] [2] [α] [2] [,][ 20][ ·]

Proof. Assume that x ≤−1 − √Cn . Since |x| > 1, then by (7) we have that
|G ω ( [√] nz)| < √ [6][K] n .
First, we want to bound below |F µ n (z)|. Observe that Re(W n (z)) ≤
x + √ [|][α] n [|] + √1n |G ω ( [√] nz)| < x + √ [|][α] n [|] + [6] n [K] [. As][ x][ ≤−][1][ −] √Cn, [√] n > 6K, and

which further implies | W n 1(z) [|][ <][ 1. Hence, we deduce that][ |][Re][(] W n 1(z) [)][|][ <][ 1.]

Therefore, Im(W n (z)) = y − √1n Im(G ω ( [√] nz)) < n [1] [+] [ 6] n [K] [. Hence, we obtain]

Proof. We deliver the estimation of this integral in three parts.
C
First, let us suppose that x ∈ [0.4, 1 − √n ]. By (7), it follows that
|G ω ( [√] nz)| < [30] √ [K] n .
Our objective is to bound −Im(G µ n (z)). We begin by bounding Im(F µ n (z)).
We claim that |W n (z)| > 0.3. Indeed, from the definition of W n (z) we see
that |W n (z)| ≥|z|− √ [|][α] n [|] −| √ [1] n G ω ( [√] nz)| > x− √ [|][α] n [|] − [30] n [K] [. So, the claim follows]


that |W n (z)| ≥|z|− √n −| √n G ω ( [√] nz)| > x− √n − n [. So, the claim follows]

as n is larger than 20 · 30K and 20 [2] α [2] .
Next, note that Im(W n (z)) = y − √1n Im(G ω ( [√] nz)) < [30][K] n [+1] . It follows


Next, note that Im(W n (z)) = y − √n Im(G ω ( [√] nz)) < n . It follows

as C > 5 and n > 16C [2] . From this estimation, (8), and (9), the desired
result follows.

Now, we are ready to conclude the proof. Let ǫ 1 = √n and ǫ 2 = √n . By
Theorem 1, we have that

that
