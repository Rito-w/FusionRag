**Abstract:**

We measure the stress state in and around a deformation nanotwin in a twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steel. Using fourdimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), we measure the elastic strain field in a 68.2-by-83.1 nm area of
interest with a scan step of 0.36 nm and a diffraction limit resolution of 0.73 nm. The stress field in and surrounding the twin matches
the form expected from analytical theory and is on the order of 15 GPa, close to the theoretical strength of the material. We infer that
the measured back-stress limits twin thickening, providing a rationale for why TWIP steel twins remain thin during deformation,
continuously dividing grains to give substantial work hardening. Our results support modern mechanistic understanding of the
influence of twinning on crack propagation and embrittlement in TWIP steels.

Understanding the mechanical behaviour of engineering alloys at
the nanoscale is critical to improving alloy design and processing,
and hence performance [1–4]. Plastic deformation by twinning or
shear-associated martensite transformation is commonly used in
alloy design strategies, from Mg to Zr, steels and body-centred
cubic (BCC) Ti alloys, as well as functional intermetallics such as
NiTi. A better understanding of the stress state and back stress
around such features will open up new avenues for improving
performance, by manipulation of composition and processing to
achieve desirable nanoscale behaviour and therefore bulk
properties. In the case of face-centred cubic (FCC) crystal
twinning, Shockley partial <112>{111} dislocations formed from
the dissociation of a full <110>{111} lattice dislocation propagate
on successive {111} planes. These impart a local strain field, and
their propagation (and therefore accumulation of plastic strain) is
limited by interaction with other lattice defects (interstitial or
substitutional solutes, additional twins, dislocations, _etc_ ).

Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy
(4D-STEM) is a relatively new technique in which an electron
diffraction pattern is acquired at every point in a scan grid. In this
regard it is similar to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), now
a routine method for microscale structural analysis [5,6], but a
much finer ‘pencil-beam’ probe permits sub-nm spatial resolution.
The trade-off is that a zone-axis generally must be identified and
aligned with the transmitted beam, inherently limiting knowledge
of the reciprocal lattice to two coplanar vectors. A comprehensive
review of 4D-STEM and its applications in strain mapping,
imaging, and ptychography is available in ref [7]. In this work we
employ the py4DSTEM open source software package, developed
by Savitzky _et al_ [8].

Lattice strain measurement with this approach is becoming fairly
routine. It has been used to investigate resistivity in
semiconductors [9,10], and more recently begun to be applied to
polycrystalline materials [11]. Pekin _et al_ [12,13] have measured
the strain field around austenitic (FCC) stainless steel features.
They observed a ~4% variation in strain across their area of
interest, which included dislocations and an annealing twin
boundary. In this study we investigate the elastic strain fields in a
similar FCC Fe material, and additionally calculate the stress fields
directly from the elastic strain measurements. Here we examine
twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steel, with a focus on thin
deformation nanotwins. Twinning-induced plasticity in these
systems can result in large ductility of up to 95% [14–16]. It is
believed that continuous subdivision of grains by ongoing twin


nucleation, without significant thickening, leads to a dynamic
‘Hall-Petch’ effect with sufficient twin back-stress to inhibit
propagation of dislocations at these barriers [17]. This leads to
pile-ups, hardening, and ductility. Deformation twins have also
been explored in the context of crack initiation in TWIP steels by
Koyama _et al_ [18]. In this study we provide a direct measurement
of the nanoscale stress state for comparison to the increasingly
cited analytical model of Müllner _et al_ [19–21]. We observe that
the analytical form of this model qualitatively corresponds well to
our measurements of local stress.

An ingot of TWIP-steel (Fe – 16.4Mn – 0.9C – 0.5Si – 0.05Nb – 0.05
V wt%) was produced by vacuum arc melting in an Ar atmosphere.
It was cast, homogenised at 1300˚C for 24 h, hot rolled with a 50%
reduction, cold rolled with a subsequent 67% reduction, and
annealed at 1000˚C for 5 min. This gave a fully austenitic
microstructure. A ‘dogbone’ tensile specimen with 1 x 1.5 mm
cross section and 19 mm gauge was deformed to 6% plastic strain

at a nominal stroke rate of 10 [-3] s [-1] . The material in this condition
has a yield strength of 1.07 GPa, ultimate tensile strength of 1.5
GPa, ductility of 33%, and work hardening rate of 3.5 GPa.

A <110> zone was selected for this experiment, defined such that
the [011] direction is out of the plane. EBSD was used to identify
a suitable grain. An electron transparent sample was then
prepared using the focussed ion beam (FIB) lift-out technique.

4D-STEM was performed using the probe and image spherical
aberration-corrected _JEOL_ ARM300CF TEM at _ePSIC_ . The pencil
beam was set-up by turning off the probe corrector hexapoles and
using the condenser and transfer lens pairs to reach a small
convergence semi-angle. Diffraction patterns were collected with
a Merlin (MediPix) direct electron detector. An accelerating
voltage of 200 kV and a camera length of 9 cm was used, with a 10
μm condenser lens aperture. Calibration diffraction data was
gathered from evaporated gold on amorphous carbon sample and
using the 10 μm aperture a 2.1 mrad convergence semi-angle and
0.0157 Å [-1 ] detector pixel size were measured. This gives a
diffraction-limited spatial resolution of 0.73 nm. A 68.2-by-83.1
nm area of interest was scanned in 188-by-229 real space pixels,
and with a 256-by-256 pixel diffraction pattern captured at each
of these scan positions, with a 1 ms dwell time per pattern.

The in-plane elastic strain tensor was calculated from the electron
diffraction pattern at each scan location. Bragg peak identification,
dataset calibration including elliptical distortion correction and
diffraction shift correction, and elastic strain calculation were
performed with the open source py4DSTEM analysis package

[8,22]. For locating Bragg peaks we use a correlation power of 1,
corresponding to cross-correlation [13], and estimate the subpixel
Bragg disc positions with local Fourier up-sampling by a factor of
16 [23].

The in-plane elastic stress was determined from the measured
strains and Hooke’s law. We make use of the axis system presented
in Figure 1 (1, 2, 3) refer to the twinning system, with the (2, 3)
plane at the interface (origin at the twin centre). In this scheme the

[111 ["] ] twin plane normal is aligned with the _2_ direction, with _1_
along [2 ["] 11 ["] ]. To calculate the stresses, we first rotate a reference
stiffness tensor, 𝐂 ['()] to our _1_, _2_, _3_ axis system. We employ

'() '()

reference stiffness tensor components C ++ = 197.5 GPa, C +, =


'() '()

reference stiffness tensor components C ++ = 197.5 GPa, C +, =

124.5 GPa, C --'() = 122.0 GPa, with subscripts referring to tensor


++'() = 197.5 GPa, C +,


124.5 GPa, C --'() = 122.0 GPa, with subscripts referring to tensor

components rather than our axis systems, as measured for a
similar austenite by Johansson _et al_ [24,25] with respect to a
<100> system. Having previously calculated the in-plane elastic
strains resolved in the [12 ["] 1] and [101 ["] ] directions, we can infer the
complete elastic stress state by assuming plane strain: we find the
unknown strain components ε 00, ε +0, and ε,0 by assuming the
stress components σ 00, σ +0, and σ,0 are zero. We then use the full


strain vector and compliance tensor to calculate the full stress
tensor, and the unknown, non-zero, σ ++, σ,,, and σ +, .

Presented in Figure 2 are ‘virtual’ bright and dark field (VBF, VDF
respectively) images reconstructed from intensity collected from
the highlighted digital apertures. VBF images (a) and (b) clearly
distinguish the twin from the matrix. Given the axis system we
have adopted, [011] out of plane, and the diffraction vectors as
indexed in Figure 2, we infer these twins have habit plane (111 ["] ).

A large amount of structure-dependent information is contained
in the direct beam. Traditional bright field imaging (where an
aperture isolates the direct beam) uses electron wave phase
information to re-interfere an image [26]. In VBF we only have
access to electron intensity in the diffraction plane, so it is likely
that the contrast we observe between twin and matrix is derived
from local strain, lattice rotation, or dynamical effects which will
alter the ratio of diffracted to direct intensity. We present two VBF
images Figure 2 (a,b) to show the presence of diffraction contrast
in the direct beam as well as in the first order diffraction spots. The
high angle VDF image in (c) is akin to conventional high-angle
annular dark field (HAADF) imaging, which indicates propensity
to scatter electrons to high angles, and suggests that there is no
detectable variation in local chemistry between the twin and the
matrix. The minimal contrast observed in (c) could be attributed
to local ordering as a precursor to the formation of coherent V-rich
carbides [27,28]. The twin is explicitly highlighted in (d) by
reconstructing the spatial image from the 2 ["] 00 reciprocal lattice
point for the twinned region only, analogous to a traditional TEM
dark field image. In (e) we present a Bragg vector map (after
Savitzky _et al_ [22]), representing a 2D probability histogram of
peak locations in the untwinned region. We note that a small
amount of density is observed at the twin reciprocal lattice points
even for the untwinned class. This is possibly due to the geometry
of the specimen, dynamical diffraction, and through-thickness
sampling of both untwinned and twinned material near the
interface.

The strain components ε ++, ε,,, ε +, were calculated from the
relative movements of the diffraction spots. This was performed
independently for the twin and the matrix. A set of reference
reciprocal lattice vectors were obtained by averaging the
untwinned region’s reciprocal lattice basis vectors. The twin basis
vectors magnitudes were normalised to this unstrained length. As
such, elastic strains are given in reference to this ‘unstrained’ state.
The measurement could be considered as the elastic strain

variation across the area of interest.

Maps of measured (11, 22, 12) and inferred (33) strain
components across the area of interest are presented in Figure 3.
Included is an integration along the 2-direction in a highlighted
area, to obtain an average profile in the 1 direction. We observe
that ε,, and ε +, remain fairly level in the matrix region between

the twins, while ε ++ exhibits more deviation. The twinned regions
exhibit an increase in ε ++ and ε,,, and a reduction in ε +, relative to
the matrix.

Maps of the stress tensor are presented in Figure 4. The same line
profile integration as for the strain maps is performed. We observe
that σ ++ and σ,, exhibit large positive stress rises across the
interface. The component σ +, is much smaller in magnitude, but
generally observes a negative ‘sense’ shear stress profile.

For comparison to an analytical micromechanical model, we
follow the formulation of Müllner _et al_ [19–21]. This considers the
elastic stress field around the twin to follow that of a disclination
dipole. Given a distance _x_ along the 1-direction, and _y_ along the 2direction, in this scheme:

With _b_ as the magnitude of the Shockley partial Burgers vector and
_h_ the separation between twinning planes. The co-ordinates _x_, _y_, _z_
are taken in reference to the centre of the disclination dipole from
which the stress field is derived [20]. Models of σ ++, σ,,, and σ +,
along the **A** - **A’** profile are included in Figure 4. We set _y_, _z_ = 0 at the
centre of the twins, and vary _y_ along the profile **A** - **A’** . We find that
an initial _x_ value of ~ -5 nm leads to stress profiles with similar
form to those we observe. This corresponds to our sample
representing an average of 5 nm along the _x_ direction away from
the disclination dipole, which is the basis of the considered model.
We use a Poisson’s ratio of 0.31, and consider a twin thickness of


10 px (3.63 nm) [25]. Note that in order to qualitatively compare
discretely sampled positions in the analytical model to our
experiments, where we expect some degree of beam overlap, we
apply a Chebyshev windowing function to the integration. This
accelerates the function’s descent towards zero in the limit, which
was necessary for superposition of the two twin stress fields in our
small area of interest.

Our strain measurements are significantly larger than previously
seen in most 4D-STEM experiments, for example the ~4% range
observed by Pekin _et al_ [13]. Stresses of the magnitude we have
measured are rarely observed under standard loading, but under
conditions of severe plastic deformation in a drawn wire these
levels are reached macroscopically [29].

Our sample has seen significant plastic strain. The tolerance for
high defect density is precisely what makes TWIP steels the
strongest and most readily work-hardening engineering materials
available. The forms and sense of the stress profiles we have
measured are similar to those predicted by the model. The
(uniaxial) theoretical strength of a material can be approximated
as Young’s Modulus / 10 in the absence of accurate potentials [30].
This is around 20 GPa in our case. Our measurements lie below this
threshold, but are close. The stresses predicted by the model
appear to exceed our approximate threshold, but follow the same
trend as the experimental results.

Koyama et al [18] have used electron channelling contrast imaging
to investigate hydrogen embrittlement initiation at deformation
twin boundaries. They observe that transgranular cracks always
propagate along twin boundaries; we have measured σ ++ to be
locally very high in a similar material, in accordance with their
observation. Furthermore, here we provide evidence of significant
strain at twin boundaries, which will attract the hydrogen and
embrittle the steel, which Koyama _et al_ set out as a softening
mechanism. As they suggest, this is despite the coherence of the Σ3
boundary, and explains observed hydrogen trapping at such
features in similar materials [31].

Finally, we suggest that the significant stress intensity observed
parallel and perpendicular to their boundaries controls their
thickening. Twin thickness is determined by the tendency to
minimise elastic strain energy. Clausen _et al_ [32] have described
the twin internal back-stress generated by matrix constraint of the
transformed twin in Mg: the plastic shear provided by the
twinning transformation is spread over the incorporating grain,
resulting in an equal and opposite elastic strain being contained
within the twin. This elastic back-strain (leading to internal backstress) is what we have observed. The twin thickness is controlled
by accommodation of the transformation strain, as there is an
energy penalty to this back-stress. The stress intensity

sub-division, and a greater work hardening rate. As deformation
progresses, plastic strain accumulation increases, resulting in a
greater elastic back-stress. Equivalently, in larger grains where the
twinning strain can be more widely distributed, the back stress is
lower and twins are able to grow thicker, as suggested by Rahman
_et al_ [1,17].

In conclusion,

- Measurement of the elastic strain and stress state around
deformation nanotwins in a TWIP steel reveals a significant
polarisation, with stresses close to, but less than, the
approximate theoretical strength of the material.

- The profiles and sense of the stresses follow those predicted
by the analytical model of Müllner _et al_ [19–21].

- The magnitude of the stress state surrounding the twin could
explain the observations and provide evidence for hydrogen
embrittlement mechanisms associated with twins set out by
Koyama _et al_ [18]. The observed stress field also likely plays
a critical role in controlling twin thickness. This determines
the rate of grain subdivision and the alloy work hardening
rate [32].
