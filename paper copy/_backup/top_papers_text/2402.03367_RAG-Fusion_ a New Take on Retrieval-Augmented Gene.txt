ABSTRACT
Infineon has identified a need for engineers, account managers, and customers to rapidly obtain
product information. This problem is traditionally addressed with retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) chatbots, but in this study, I evaluated the use of the newly popularized RAG-Fusion method.
RAG-Fusion combines RAG and reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) by generating multiple queries,
reranking them with reciprocal scores and fusing the documents and scores. Through manually
evaluating answers on accuracy, relevance, and comprehensiveness, I found that RAG-Fusion was
able to provide accurate and comprehensive answers due to the generated queries contextualizing the
original query from various perspectives. However, some answers strayed off topic when the generated
queries’ relevance to the original query is insufficient. This research marks significant progress in
artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) applications and demonstrates
transformations in a global and multi-industry context.

Introduction
Infineon account managers and field application engineers have expressed the need to obtain sales-oriented product
information rapidly, but Infineon’s product selection guides and datasheets are often hundreds of pages long. Born from
this need was the rapid development of chatbots to provide account managers and engineers with technical information
in seconds. These chatbots are built off the state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented generation framework.
Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been at the core of all of Infineon’s virtual assistants. Retrieval-
augmented generation answers a user’s questions related to the purpose of the virtual assistant. The method combines
text generation from large language models (LLMs) and document retrieval from databases of related documents to
generate accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses. (Yu 2022) Large language models are advanced natural
language processing systems trained on large sets of data that process and generate text. While they are designed to
handle tasks like machine translation, summarization, and conversational interactions, RAG models can also leverage
them for information retrieval. [ 2] RAG has shown remarkable success in several knowledge-intensive natural language
processing tasks including accurate trivia question answering, highly accurate fact verification, and accurately answering
middle school math questions. [ 3] [4] In addition, retrieval-augmented generation reduces misinformation typically
produced by large language models and non-RAG chatbots. [5]
Document retrieval is a fundamental component of the algorithm. Traditional RAG virtual assistants rank documents
in the order of relevance to the query, usually by vector distances. This means that the more relevant a document
is in a query, the higher priority it takes being in the answer. Recently, however, developers and researchers have
explored implementing different reranking methods for documents. It has been found that reranking in retrieval-
augmented generation plays a significant role in improving retrieval results and in increasing the accuracy, relevance,
and comprehensiveness of answers. [6]
Reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) is a reranking algorithm that gives a reciprocal rank to documents in multiple sources,
then combines those ranks and documents into one final reranked list. It has been found that RRF outperforms manyarXiv:2402.03367v2  [cs.IR]  21 Feb 2024
RAG-Fusion: a New Take on Retrieval-Augmented Generation
other document reranking methods while being sensitive to its parameters. [ 7] [8] Utilizing RRF as a reranker in a RAG
algorithm yields RAG-Fusion, a novel RAG-based chatbot model popularized by Adrian H. Raudaschl. [9]
The chatbot I developed in this paper was initially a traditional RAG bot developed to be used by automotive field
engineers. But I found that there was a need for customers and distributors to use this chatbot as well from questions
asked online in our developer community. [ 10] Accordingly, I changed the model of the chatbot from RAG to RAG-
Fusion with the hypothesis that it would provide answers that not only held the same accuracy as the RAG chatbot, but
were also more comprehensive in addressing various perspectives of users’ questions. Thus, I tested the bot for viability
in the following three areas: answering product-specific questions from engineers, answering sales teams’ queries about
sales strategies, and answering customer queries about products. Specifically, I focused on answering questions related
to our silicon MEMs microphones and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). [11] [12]
RAG vs RAG-Fusion
The traditional retrieval-augmented generation chatbot model for specific product information consists of the following
steps:
•Gather product documents (e.g., datasheets, and product selection guides) in a database of documents for
retrieval into text.
•Create vector embeddings – numerical representations of the text that the algorithm can understand – and store
them in a vector database.
Upon receiving a query from the user,
• Retrieve the nmost relevant documents based on vector distance to the original query via vector search.
•Send the query together with the retrieved documents to a large language model to generate a response and
output the response.
RAG-Fusion, on the other hand, has a few extra steps. [ 13] Once the original query is received, the model sends the
original query to the large language model to generate a number of new search queries based on the original query. For
example, if the user’s original query is "Tell me about MEMs microphones," the generated queries may include
•What are MEMs microphones and how do they work?
•What are the advantages of using MEMs microphones?
•What are some recommended MEMs microphones?
The algorithm then performs vector search to find a number of relevant documents like with RAG. But, instead of
sending those documents with the queries to the large language model to generate the output, the model performs
reciprocal rank fusion. Reciprocal rank fusion is an algorithm commonly used in search to assign scores to every
document and rerank them according to the scores. The scores assigned to each document, or rrf scores, are
rrfscore =1
rank +k(1)
where rank is the current rank of the documents sorted by distance, and kis a constant smoothing factor that determines
the weight given to the existing ranks. Upon each calculation of the score, the rrf score is accumulated with previous
scores for the same document, and when all scores are accumulated, documents are fused together and reranked
according to their scores. The model then sends the reranked results along with the generated queries and the original
queries to the large language model to produce an output.

Rating”
Infineon Chatbot for Engineers
There are three potential use cases of the Infineon RAG-Fusion chatbot: providing technical information to engineers,
providing sales-oriented information to account managers, and providing customer-facing information to customers.
To test the viability of the chatbot in providing information to engineers, I gathered a list of technical questions from
Infineon’s developer community forum regarding our products. [ 10] I then optimized the questions to produce the best
output with the RAG-Fusion. This included correcting spelling and grammar, converting statements into questions, and
dividing multi-part questions into a single query. I then compared the accuracy of the RAG-Fusion chatbot in answering
the technical questions against the correct forum solutions provided by Infineon experts. Take the following question
for example.
Query: IP rating of mounted IM72D128
Generated queries: [’1. What is the IP rating of the mounted IM72D128?’, ’2. IP rating explained
for mounted IM72D128.’, ’3. Waterproofing capabilities of the IM72D128 with its IP rating.’, ’4.
How does the IP rating of the IM72D128 affect its durability when mounted?’]
Bot answer: The mounted IM72D128 has an IP57 rating, indicating a high level of protection
against both dust and water. The first digit, 5, signifies its resistance to solid objects like dust or dirt.
The second digit, 7, represents its resistance to water. This rating means that the IM72D128 has a
sealed design, preventing water or dust from entering between the membrane and backplate. This
robust design ensures no mechanical blockages or electric leakage issues typically seen in MEMS
microphones. As a result, the IM72D128 is highly durable and can withstand exposure to water
and dust without significant damage. Its sealed MEMS design allows it to function properly even in
challenging environmental conditions, providing long-term durability and reliable performance.
Forum solution: Yes, you are right. IM72D128 has IP57 rating. The recommended Reflow soldering
and board assembly of the microphone is given in section 7 (page: 14-15) of the datasheet. Please
also refer to the application note: MEMS microphone mechanical & acoustical implementation.
In this case, the chatbot provided a correct answer, that the IM72D128 microphone has an IP57 rating. Unlike the forum
solution, however, the chatbot not only provided the rating, but also explained what the rating signifies. In addition,
it provided information about the microphone’s sealed design, ensuring no mechanical blockage or electric leakage
issues, and a final statement summarizing its strengths. This extra information was derived from the generated queries
and provided an answer that was not only correct, but also more comprehensive and had more context surrounding the
question compared to the forum solution. The only part missing from the answer is that the microphone delivers high
3

ingress IP57 protection at a microphone level because of Infineon’s latest Sealed Dual Membrane MEMS technology.
This missing part may be solved, however, by increasing the number of queries generated or documents retrieved.
In addition to technical product questions, many engineers also ask for help troubleshooting or product instructions.
The bot, however, tends to answer these questions with very general instructions and by indicating the user should
follow up with Infineon. The following query highlights this tendency.
How to connect and communicate with the PDM interface of IM69D130 with stm32
The bot lists six steps, five of which are mainly general guidance, with one step matching the expert solution:
Bot: Configure the PDM interface settings on the STM32 microcontroller according to the require-
ments of the IM69D130, including clock frequency, data format, and other parameters.
Forum: Set up the data format on the I2S interface to match the PDM data from the IM69D130.
However, the forum answer emphasizes that the IS2 interface of the microcontroller must be in slave receive mode,
which is nowhere to be found in the bot’s answer. This is most likely because the product database does not contain this
kind of guidance. None of the documents mention slave receiver mode, which is a keyword in the response. Since it is
unable to retrieve this information, the language model makes up for this by outputting its prior knowledge to supplement
the missing information from the documents, which are general troubleshooting steps and not product-specific steps.
This tendency can be solved by providing correct documentation in the database regarding troubleshooting and methods
to use the product.
Infineon Chatbot for Account Managers
Although its original purpose was to be used for engineers, the bot ended up performing the best in response to
sales-oriented questions. These are questions that are asked by account managers or inside sales representatives that
give insight into the benefits of Infineon products and sales strategies.
To devise sales strategies, the bot retrieves the documents related to the specific products, in the following case our
100V Linear Field-effect Transistor (FET). It then synthesizes the product knowledge with logic from the large language
model to create a valuable strategy based on accurate product information. Generating multiple queries is key to
devising a comprehensive and multiperspective sales strategy. For example, in response to the prompt
How do I sell a 100V OptiMOS Linear FET for power over ethernet to my customer?
the bot generates unique prompts addressing market trends and customer preferences, best practices for selling electrical
components, the value proposition of our Linear FET, and strategies for effectively pitching the benefits and features of
our Linear FET. The answer generated by the chatbot addresses these queries by providing technical specifications
such as the latest IEEE 802.3bt standard increasing the available power via Power over Ethernet (PoE). It continues
to highlight Infineon’s expertise in switched-mode power supply designs and our FETs’ high efficiency, protection,
best-in-class performance with ultra-low RDS(on) and low charge, and high reliability. It responds that the value
proposition includes improving efficiency and power density, low conduction losses, and high switching performance
leading to energy savings and better thermal management. For sales strategies, it suggests highlighting its value
proposition, advantages in performance and efficiency, and the importance to understand customer-specific needs
and requirements for their applications. It ends with suggesting the account manager provide technical support and
assistance, which ties back into our Infineon chatbot use case for engineers.
This sales-oriented question answering for account managers reduces the need for an account manager to ask an
engineer for product information as well as the engineer’s need to sift through a 100-page datasheet. This saves times
for everyone in the process and increases the account manager’s ability to sell the product, resulting in more sales and
higher revenue.
Inside sales representatives often need to quickly find product-specific information. This is similar to the use case for
engineers, but instead of technical information like voltage and current density, it is information about applications and
product validation.
Query: What is the application of IM73A135V01?
Bot response: Based on the provided documents, the IM73A135V01 is a dust and water resistant
analog XENSIVTM MEMS microphone with a best-in-class Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of 73dB(A)
for high-quality audio pick-up. It also has a flat frequency response and low distortion. In addition,
it is IP57 robust to dust and water. While the documents do not specifically mention application
4
RAG-Fusion: a New Take on Retrieval-Augmented Generation
examples or industry applications for the IM73A135V01, it is a robust and high-performance MEMS
microphone that can be used in various audio devices such as TWS earbuds and compact audio
devices. Based on its features and benefits, it can be used in applications that require high-quality
audio pick-up, low distortion, and dust/water resistance. Some potential applications could include
consumer electronics, automotive, industrial, and smart devices.
Infineon Chatbot for Customers
While the chatbot provides great support for sales teams, it is also able to provide comprehensive and helpful feedback
for customers’ product-related questions. These are not engineering questions, but rather questions from customers who
are considering buying our products. For example, a customer could be looking to manufacture a camera and wants to
know whether our microphones are a good fit for their camera. In fact, this was a real question asked on our developer
community. [10]
Query: Is the IM72D128 microphone good to use in an outdoor surveillance camera?
Bot response: The IM72D128V01 microphone is an ideal choice for outdoor surveillance cameras
based on several documents. Document 1 states that it is IP57 dust and water resistant, making it able
to withstand the conditions typically encountered in outdoor settings. Document 7 further describes
it as an ultra-high-performance digital microphone with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low
distortions, which ensures clear and high-quality audio capture. This makes it well-suited for outdoor
surveillance cameras that require excellent audio capture capabilities. Additionally, Document 8
mentions that the IM72D128V01 microphone is designed for both indoor and outdoor automotive
applications, offers best-in-class audio performance, and has an extended temperature range. These
features can be advantageous for outdoor surveillance cameras as well, emphasizing its suitability for
capturing audio in outdoor environments.
With this answer, the customer understands that our IM72D128 microphone does align with their project, resulting in a
higher chance of a new sale.
Benefits of a Chatbot
Customers and engineers tend to ask several questions in one query, and Infineon experts tend to respond to the main
question and not the several smaller ones asked. With a chatbot, albeit in separate queries, users can ask all their
questions and get answers.
In addition to product-specific knowledge, a chatbot can leverage pretrained knowledge from its large language model
that an Infineon expert may not have. For example, one question asked by a customer was regarding whether MEMs
microphones could be used in wooden instruments or professional recording studios. While our expert responded by
pointing to the MEMs microphone product page and datasheets, the RAG-Fusion bot was able to provide a useful and
comprehensive answer drawing on its prior trained knowledge and database of MEMs microphones.
MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) microphones are small devices that convert sound waves
into electrical signals. They utilize a diaphragm that vibrates in response to sound waves and an
acoustic sensor that detects these vibrations. The sensor then translates the vibrations into electrical
signals, which can be amplified and processed for various applications.
The advantages of using MEMS microphones in stage or professional studio recordings are significant.
Their small size allows for easy integration into equipment and placement in different areas. They
offer high-performance audio capture with low self-noise, wide dynamic range, and high sensitivity.
MEMS microphones also provide excellent audio quality, enabling accurate and precise sound
reproduction. Additionally, their compact design enables the creation of microphone arrays for noise
cancellation and beamforming, enhancing audio capture in complex acoustic environments.
However, when using MEMS microphones in wooden instruments on stage or in professional studio
recordings, there may be limitations or challenges. One potential limitation is their sensitivity to
handling noise, as MEMS microphones can be more sensitive to vibrations and movements compared
to traditional microphones. This requires careful handling and mounting to minimize unwanted
noise. Additionally, the frequency response of MEMS microphones may not perfectly match the
tonal characteristics of wooden instruments, necessitating careful selection and placement to achieve
the desired sound.
5
RAG-Fusion: a New Take on Retrieval-Augmented Generation
To capture the sound of wooden instruments effectively, some recommended MEMS microphones
include models like the Infineon-IM73D122 or the Infineon-IM72D128. These microphones offer
high sensitivity, low self-noise, and a wide dynamic range, making them suitable for capturing the
nuances and details of wooden instruments. However, it is important to experiment and select the
microphone that best suits the specific instrument and desired sound.
In summary, MEMS microphones can be used in wooden instruments on stage or in professional
studio recordings, offering advantages such as small size, high audio quality, and the ability to
capture details and nuances. However, careful consideration should be given to microphone selection,
placement, and handling to overcome any potential limitations or challenges.
Challenges of RAG-Fusion
The largest challenge of RAG-Fusion is the slow answer time from receiving the query to outputting the answer. I
compared the runtime to our traditional RAG chatbot by performing ten back-to-back runs with the same query. I then
subtracted the time when the query was received from the time the output was given to determine the time it took for
that run. Back-to-back runs should control for APIs having different response times at different times of the day.
Table 1: Comparison of RAG-Fusion Time and RAG Time in Smart Speaker Runs
Run RAG-Fusion Time (s) RAG Time (s)
1 42.72 30.48
2 32.05 32.93
3 12.85 25.94
4 42.78 16.70
5 36.58 11.89
6 45.99 10.62
7 34.92 17.58
8 35.56 14.42
9 37.55 28.21
10 25.19 6.44
Average 34.62 19.52
Observation: RAG-Fusion takes 1.77 times longer.
Although it is hard to generalize exact runtime numbers, this average over ten back-to-back runs shows that RAG-Fusion
bot is almost certainly slower than the RAG bot. In this case, RAG’s average runtime from query to output was 19.52
seconds, with RAG-Fusion being nearly 1.77 times as slow with an average query to output time of 34.62 seconds.
Moreover, this trend is evident in all individual runs but runs two and three.
After performing several runs with different queries and at different times, I determined that the slowness of RAG-Fusion
compared to RAG can be mostly attributed to the second API call to the large language model. Even in long queries of
70 or more words, the call to generate multiple queries never took more than 5 seconds. The model then ran through
document retrieval and reciprocal rank fusion almost instantly until it stopped for the second API call for several
seconds. The second API call’s complexity is amplified by the volume and diversity of the input in the form of multiple
queries and a substantial number of documents in contrast to the much simpler call in RAG with one query and fewer
documents. Two ways to overcome this slowness included hosting an LLM locally to reduce latency in the calls to the
LLM and decreasing the number of queries generated by the first API call.
Another challenge of RAG-Fusion is the inability to empirically evaluate answers. While evaluation frameworks like
ROUGE, BLEU, BLEURT, and METEOR are often applied to assess the accuracy of retrieval-augmented generation
models, in the case of the Infineon chatbot, there is not necessarily a direct, expected answer. Thus, such evaluation
frameworks are less effective for tasks such as the sales and customer-oriented answering where outputs can vary
significantly in structure and content while still being correct.
New evaluation toolkits such as RAGElo and Ragas have recently emerged. Such frameworks seek to provide automated
evaluation for RAG-based models. RAGElo takes in a list of questions, documents, and answers. It then assigns a
tournament-style Elo ranking of multiple RAG pipelines over different queries and prompts [ 14]. Ragas provides
empirical assessment scores in context precision, faithfulness, and answer relevancy [ 15]. Despite promising results on
evaluating RAG-based agents, further tweaking to these evaluation methods is needed to align with the unique goals of
the Infineon RAG-Fusion chatbot.
6
RAG-Fusion: a New Take on Retrieval-Augmented Generation
The evaluation method that reflects RAG-Fusion’s goals are human evaluations based on accuracy, relevance, and
comprehensiveness. Ratings from Infineon account managers and engineers provide the best insight into answer quality
from an expert lens. For the purposes of this paper, however, I manually evaluated the responses based on the same
scale. I found that RAG-Fusion excels in accuracy and comprehensiveness, but occasionally strays in relevance. This
occurs when irrelevant queries are generated by the large language model. While the answers to the generated queries
were accurate and comprehensive, they strayed from the intention of the original question if the generated query it
answered differed too much from the intent of the original query.
To achieve answers that completely match the intention of the original query, users must sometimes engineer prompts
to be more specific and comprehensible so that the large language model generates appropriate queries. An example
question from a distributor was regarding whether our IM72D128 microphone is good for them to use in a security
camera: "If it was Okay, it is very good for out-door surveillance camera," with "If it was Okay" referring to whether
water and dust come through the sound port. The first prompt I tried for this question was "Is IM72D128 very good for
an out-door surveillance camera?" However, the language model did not recognize my intention of the phrase "good for"
and thus generated prompts labeling IM72D128 as a surveillance camera itself. I was able to generate relevant queries
with IM72D128 understood to be a microphone used in a surveillance camera with the prompt "Is the IM72D128
microphone good to use in an outdoor surveillance camera?" Situations like this can be remedied by providing a prompt
creation guide to users, but in the long run I would like to investigate ways to integrate prompt engineering into the bot
side rather than forcing the burden on users.
Another challenge of RAG-Fusion, which is also a challenge of RAG, is its inability to provide definitively negative
answers. Below is an example of when the bot could not find documents relating to the user’s query.
Query: We need to Confirm whether the IFX waterproof MIC has a Sleeping mode and wake-up
functions
Response: Based on the provided documents, it is uncertain whether the IFX waterproof MIC has
sleeping mode and wake-up functions, as none of the documents explicitly mention these features.
To obtain accurate information, it is recommended to refer to the official documentation or reach out
to the manufacturer directly for confirmation.
Forum solution: Our microphone does not come with sleep mode and wake up functionality. With
respect power optimization, our microphone comes with low power mode.
While the bot was correct that there is no mention of sleeping mode and wake-up functions in the database of product
information, it did not provide a firmly negative answer. This is because the nature of the bot is centered around
document retrieval and not providing clear negative answers.
Conclusion
I found that the Infineon RAG-Fusion chatbot was able to provide more accurate and comprehensive answers than
traditional RAG models. This includes answers for questions related to technical product information for engineers,
sales strategies for account managers, and customer-oriented product explanations. This is due to the generation of
multiple queries based on the original query, which allows the chatbot to answer questions from multiple angles. In
addition, using RRF to rerank the documents retrieved results in the most relevant documents getting the highest priority
in answer generation.
While RAG-Fusion increases answer quality, it comes with challenges such as a longer runtime than other models
due to a more complex call to the LLM with multiple queries and more documents, answers going off track from the
original query due to irrelevant queries generated by the first LLM call, and the occasional need for appropriate prompt
engineering to generate the desired outcome.
Many questions asked on the developer forum were from customers and distributors in non-English speaking countries.
When customers translate their original questions to English, some context may be lost and thus, customers may not
receive the answers they want from Infineon experts. This was clear with the previously discussed question regarding
the usage of MEMs microphones in security cameras. In the future, I will expand the Infineon RAG-Fusion chatbot to
answer in languages other than English, especially Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.
I will also research ways to better represent multimodal pdf datasheets as text for retrieval-augmented generation.
This will allow RAG-Fusion chatbots to retrieve answers from more granular text, resulting in a higher accuracy of
specific product information and reduced hallucination frequency. I will evaluate and tweak systematic frameworks like
RAGElo and Ragas according to RAG-Fusion’s accuracy and performance. Other future research includes optimizing

methods to improve real-time performance optimization, automated quality assurance, and integration into internal and
external web platforms.
