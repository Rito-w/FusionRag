#### 📝 摘要
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a crucial method
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and integrating external knowledge into their re-
sponses. Existing RAG methods typically employ query
rewriting to clarify the user intent and manage multi-hop
logic, while using hybrid retrieval to expand search scope.
However, the tight coupling of query rewriting to the dense
retriever limits its compatibility with hybrid retrieval, im-
peding further RAG performance improve...

#### 📝 摘要
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach to infuse a private knowledge base of documents with Large Language Models (LLM) to build Generative Q\&A (Question-Answering) systems. However, RAG accuracy becomes increasingly challenging as the corpus of documents scales up, with Retrievers playing an outsized role in the overall RAG accuracy by extracting the most relevant document from the corpus to provide context to the LLM. In this paper, we propose the 'Blended RAG' method of...

#### 📝 摘要
Hybrid retrieval techniques in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems enhance information retrieval by combining dense and sparse (e.g.,
BM25-based) retrieval methods. However, existing approaches struggle
with adaptability, as fixed weighting schemes fail to adjust to different
queries. To address this, we propose DAT (Dynamic Alpha Tuning), a novel
hybrid retrieval framework that dynamically balances dense retrieval and
BM25 for each query. DAT leverages a large language model (LLM) to

This study proposes a novel hybrid retrieval strategy for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
that integrates cosine similarity and cosine distance measures to improve retrieval performance, par-
ticularly for sparse data. The traditional cosine similarity measure is widely used to capture the sim-
ilarity between vectors in high-dimensional spaces. However, it has been shown that this measure can
yield arbitrary results in certain scenarios. To address this limitation, we incorporate cosine di...

Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language comprehension and generation but are prone to hallucinations, producing factually incorrect or unsupported outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this issue by grounding LLM responses with external knowledge. This study evaluates the relationship between retriever effectiveness and hallucination reduction in LLMs using three retrieval approaches: sparse retrieval based on BM25 keyword search, dense retrieval using semantic sea...

Given a semi-structured knowledge base
(SKB), where text documents are intercon-
nected by relations, how can we effectively re-
trieve relevant information to answer user ques-
tions? Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
retrieves documents to assist large language
models (LLMs) in question answering; while
Graph RAG (GRAG) uses structured knowl-
edge bases as its knowledge source. However,
many questions require both textual and rela-
tional information from SKB — referred to as
